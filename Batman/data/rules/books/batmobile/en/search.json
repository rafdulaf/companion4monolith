P.4 * COMPONENTS’ DESCRIPTION ............................................................................................................. P.6 With a mechanical buzz the lift springs to life, revealing the jet-black sheen of the Batmobile. The Dark Knight releases the remote and strides toward his vehicle … As the ramp rises, robotic arms adjust and install myriad components, creating a custom loadout suited to the mission at hand. Tonight, Batman requires speed and firepower, and he shall have it. In a matter of minutes, the patented Wayne Tech instruments have made the Batmobile the fastest vehicle on the streets and loaded it with more firepower than a tank. In the blink of an eye, it clears the cave exit, speeding toward Gotham City. Onboard scanners track and assess all available information relating to the night’s illegal activities. Before Batman is even sure of the nature of the crime, the car is on its way to the scene… Along the way, enemies give chase. They throw everything they can at this unstoppable black juggernaut— rams, bullets, missiles… but it is useless. The high-tech defenses absorb every fruitless strike, and weapon systems counter and neutralize all threats. The Batmobile screeches to a stop beneath the ominous shadow of an abandoned ware-house. The engine stops, but the onboard computer remains active. At the push of a button, a missile launcher slides from the back of the vehicle and locks in place. A second to aim, the flip of a switch, and the façade of the building explodes in a cloud of concrete dust and debris. The roof snaps open and the Dark Knight is propelled skyward. He disappears into the brooding murk, but the car remains, silent and waiting for the next command.

In the game, the Batmobile is considered a character, except it is played with a Batmobile board rather than a character tile. The Batmobile board is assembled during mission setup. Different components are allocated to each of the component spaces to create a unique version for that mission. 1 , 2 , 3 , 3.2 3.5 3.4 3.3 4 , 1 · NAME 2 · ARTWORK 3 · COMPONENTS CLASSES 3.1 · ARMOR 3.2 · ON-BOARD COMPUTER 3.3 · ENGINE 3.4 · WEAPON 3.5 · ACCESSORIES 4 · COMPONENT SLOTS : Each class of component is paired with a specific slot shape, corresponding to a component space. 5 · TOTAL MAXIMUM LEVELS OF BATMOBILE’S COMPO-NENTS 5 , 3.1 I .

During mission setup, before the heroes choose their bat-gadgets, the controller of the Batmobile must as -semble it by choosing the different components from the available options. To do so, the hero must select one component for each component class. The following restrictions apply: -Each component class can only accommodate a component for which the component slot corresponds. -A t the end of assembly, there must not be any empty component slot. -The total of the component levels chosen must not exceed the total maximum levels of Batmobile’s components. Once the Batmobile has been assembled, the control-ler of the Batmobile places its miniature on its star -ting space as indicated on the mission setup diagram. BATMOBILE’S USE The controller of the Batmobile can perform actions that are specific to vehicles. These are called vehicle actions. These vehicle actions are given by certain compo-nents or by the mission’s special rules. During actions, the controller of the Batmobile can -not perform paid rerolls. During Batmobile defenses, it’s controller ignores the Spend Energy Cubes and Create the Dice Pool steps. The size of the Batmobile is equal to the occupation limit of its area. 1 2 3 FIG._1 · Assembly of the Batmobile. 1 2 2 1 + + + = + 3 FIG._1 , I B , I C , L _____ _ (i i• ~ ------') 1 ~ 1 ~ ---•------~) ~ ---•-----1 L ______ ~L------~ ","6 The Batmobile’s armor corresponds to its automa-tic defense level. This value indicates the number of automatic successes allocated during the defense steps. The armor also indicates its life points. After having selected the armor, its controller places the life points token of the Batmobile on the corresponding space of the turn track. The on-board computer allows vehicle actions to be carried out. Level 1 : Allows the controller of the Batmobile to activate it once per turn. To do so, they perform an automatic thought. It allows them to immediately perform one vehicle action with the Batmobile. Level 2 : Allows the controller of the Batmobile to activate it once per turn. To do so, they perform an automatic thought. It allows them to immediately perform two vehicle actions with the Batmobile. Level 3 : Allows the controller of the Batmobile to activate it once per turn. To do so, they perform an automatic thought ignoring the Spend Energy Cubes step. It allows them to immediately perform two vehicle actions with the Batmobile. The engine allows the Batmobile to perform a mo -vement at the cost of one vehicle action . During a Batmobile movement, carry out the fol -lowing steps : -1- Its controller removes the Batmobile from the board. It will later be placed in another of the Batmobile areas during the next Trigger the Start of the Heroes’ Turn Effects step. The Batmobile areas are indicated on the mission setup diagram. -2- Immediately after it is placed back on the board, the Batmobile pushes back all the minia-tures in its area. Pushing back miniatures : When the Batmobile pushes back miniatures, all the miniatures present in its area must be moved to an adjacent area chosen by the owners of the minia -tures. The hero player moves their miniatures first. When the miniatures are pushed back, the occu-pation limit of an area must be respected. If all the adjacent areas are fully occupied for a pushed minia -ture, it is immediately neutralized. Level 1 : The normal Batmobile movement rule ap -plies. Level 2 : The normal Batmobile movement rule ap -plies except that each miniature pushed back by the Batmobile rolls 2 yellow dices. They then suffer a nu -mber of wounds equal to the successes obtained. Level 3 : The normal Batmobile movement rule ap -plies with the following exceptions : -The Batmobile is immediately placed into play after having been removed from the board, -Each miniature pushed back by the Batmobile rolls 2 yellow dices. They then suffer a number of wounds equal to the successes obtained. The weapon allows the Batmobile to perform ranged attacks at the cost of one vehicle action . To do so, its controller follows the rules of a Character Ranged Attack action with the following exceptions: -During the Create the Dice Pool step, the weapon level determines the dice characteris-tics used for the attack, -The level of the weapon determines the abilities that can be used.
