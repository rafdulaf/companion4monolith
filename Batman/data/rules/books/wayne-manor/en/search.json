["","2 C O N N E C T I O N _ 3 5 M b / s “I’ve decided to be honest with you... Since the death of my parents, I have rebuilt my life as best as I could. Often at the price of great sacrifice and suffering. Thank you, Alfred, for your unwavering support and for helping to make me the man I am today. All of this has allowed me to be reborn and meet him. When I put on his costume to become a shadow in the darkness. I sometimes get lost, but up until now I have always been able to return to the light, leaving him behind me. But today, I’m doubtful... Am I truly doing good? Or am I just like them? Was I wrong to adopt you? Have I robbed you of your childhood?.. All these questions that haunt me remain unanswered. These fears are the cross that I bear, that push me to clean the city that rises from the filth. Sometimes I wonder, Jason, if your extreme ways are not the answer. And whether I was wrong to want to bring you back to the light, my son. These are his thoughts, and they terrify me! I dare to hope that I will never betray my up-bringing. But he’s making my job more and more difficult. By taking up his cape, I have the impression more and more that he is taking me over. Try to remember our values. They have made you what you are and what you must strive to stay. Never make the choice to kill. Remember that this choice is too easy. By not doing so you will be able to escape his hold over you. If I’m telling you all this today, it is because I no longer feel the strength to put on his costume. I would like to appoint my successor as Batman... No… I cannot inflict that on them. After all, it was me that brought him to Gotham. I alone must shoulder this burden. Computer! Delete this message! Prepare the costume and the Bat-mobile! We have work to do.” WAYNE MANOR This expansion is dedicated to heroes. The players will confront each other in the Wayne Manor as well as the various Batcaves hidden throughout Gotham City.
