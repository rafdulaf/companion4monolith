Each Mission requires a fixed number of Heroes, and while it is possible for one player to play more than 1 Hero, for your first game you may wish to choose a Mission that has the same number of Heroes as you have Hero players. Once you have chosen a Mission to play, keep its pages in the Missions Booklet open; you will need to refer to them during setup, as well as during play. FIND THE MAP BOARD indicated by your chosen Mission and place it in the center of the play area. NOTE: Some Missions also require the Map tile; where this is used, place it beside the Map board. II . GAME SETUP A game of Batman™: Gotham City Chronicles covers one Mission, which you choose before starting setup. You may choose any Mission from those in the Missions Booklet; each one is self-contained, and you may play them in any order. GAME SETUP "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || GAME SETUP 9 "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || GAME SETUP 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 HEROES’ PLAY AREA The Hero players work together to control a total of 1 to 3 Heroes. The Missions Booklet indicates the num- ber of Heroes required for your chosen Mission, as well as the specific Heroes that you must choose from. You must play with the exact number of Heroes listed for the Mission, even if it means a player takes control of more than one Hero. First, choose one of the available Heroes from each set, as indicated by the Mission. For example, in ‘To Sink a City’, the Hero players must choose a total of 3 Heroes to use. SERVICE GUN RENEE MONTOYA BATMAN SELECT HERO 1 ST CATWOMAN TASER HANDGUN CLAWS BLUEBIRD CATWOMAN SELECT HERO 2 ND THE LONG HALLOWEEN CASSANDRA CAIN ORPHAN BATON X2 NIGHTWING REVOLVER SELECT HERO 3 RD RED HOOD JASON TODD The 1 st Hero must be either Batman or Renee Montoya. The 2 nd Hero must be one of Catwoman, Bluebird, or Catwoman (The Long Halloween). The 3 rd Hero must be one of Red Hood (Jason Todd), Nightwing, or Orphan (Cassandra Cain). II A , For each chosen Hero: 1, · PLACE 1 BAT-TABLET in reach of its controlling player. 2, · PLACE THE CORRESPONDING HERO’S SCREEN into the Bat-Tablet. 3, · TAKE THE MINIATURE for the Hero. This will be placed on the board later in setup. 4, · TAKE A NUMBER OF ENERGY CUBES as shown on the Hero’s Screen. Place a number of these as indi- cated by the Mission into the Fatigue Zone, and the remainder into the Reserve Zone. Batman’s Screen indicates that he has a total of 11 Energy cubes 1 . The Mission indicates that 5 of these start in the Fatigue Zone 2 . 5 cubes are placed in the Fatigue Zone 3 with the remaining 6 placed in the Reserve Zone 4 . 5, · PLACE 1 STANCE MARKER beside the Bat-Tablet. 6, · MOST HEROES COME WITH ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS as indicated near their character portrait for the chosen Mission. For these Heroes, refer to Additional Hero Setup on page 13 for details after setting up the rest of the Mission. For example, Batman starts the Mission with some Bat- Gadgets 1 , Catwoman starts with the Equipment card Claws 2 , and Renee Montoya has the Command Skill, giving her control of some allied miniatures, as well as a Service Gun Equipment card 3 . 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 SERVICE GUN RENEE MONTOYA CLAWS CATWOMAN BATMAN "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || GAME SETUP 7, 2, 6, 3, 1, 8, 4, 5, 6 11 VILLAIN’S PLAY AREA Place the Command Post in front of the Villain player and place the following into it: NOTE: The tiles in steps 1-5 below are double-sided; place them gray side up. The blue side is used in other modes of play found in expansions. 1, · THE OVERLAY TILE. 2, · THE RESERVE ZONE TILE with a number of Energy cubes placed on it, as indicated by the Mission. 3, · THE FATIGUE ZONE TILE with a number of Energy cubes placed on it, as indicated by the Mission. 4, · THE RECOVERY VALUE TILE showing value 3 or 5, as indicated by the Mission. For example, this Mission indicates that 9 Energy cubes are placed in the Reserve Zone 1 and 2 are placed in the Fatigue Zone 2 . The Recovery Value is set to 5 3 . 5, · THE SQUARE-SHAPED MOVEMENT, DEFENSE (value 4), and REROLL SPACE TILES, in that order, from left to right beneath the Overlay tile. NOTE: Leave the value 3 Defense tile in the game box unless the Mission indicates otherwise. 6, · TAKE ALL OF THE CHARACTER TILES as indicated by the Mission. Create the River (the row of tiles along the bottom of the Command Post) by placing the Character tiles shown, face up from left to right in the correct order. Also, add the EVENT WARNING TILE to the River in the indicated position. Any Character tiles not included in the River are placed nearby. NOTES: • Depending on the Mission, there may be some empty spaces to the right of the starting River. • Some Missions have Character tiles that are controlled by the Heroes, or are Neutral. See the individual Missions for details. Here, the Character tile and miniature for Bane (Venom Injected) are depicted separately from the starting River 1 , indicating that these components are set aside at the start of the game. 7, · TAKE THE INDICATED NUMBER OF MINIATURES correspon- ding to each of the Character tiles for the Mission. Create the Character Pool near the Command Post with the number of miniatures indicated by the Mission (if any). Also, if the Mission specifies any miniatures to be set aside during setup, do this now (these miniatures should be separate from the Character Pool). Any remaining miniatures will be placed on the Map board later in setup. For example, here, you take 4 miniatures of Owls (with Handgun) 1 . For example, in ‘Year 100’, a number of miniatures start off in the Character Pool and not on the Map 2 . 8, · TAKE THE LIFE POINT MARKER FOR EACH CHARACTER TILE with a Life Point value larger than 1 (depicted below their corresponding Character tile in the Mission). For each Character tile in the River that has a Life Point marker, place the marker into the Command Post and place an ENERGY CUBE on the numbered space of the Life Point track above that Life Point marker, matching the star- ting Life Points for that Character. Life Point markers for miniatures not on the Map at the start of the Mission are set aside; the Mission lists when these come into play. NOTE: Some Life Point markers are double-sided; where this applies the two sides are shown as overlapping. Use the side based on which miniature is currently in play. For example, ‘To Sink a City’ requires the double-sided Life Point marker showing Bane on one side and Bane (Venom Injected) on the other 1 . Bane starts with 6 Life Points 2 .

OTHER SETUP 1, · PLACE THE ROUND TRACK next to the board, with the side of your choice face up (there is no gameplay difference). 2, · PUT THE ROUND MARKER on the hourglass space of the Round track, showing the color matching the side with Initiative, as indicated by the Mission (blue for the Heroes; gray for the Villains). For example, this Mission indicates that the Heroes are the side with Initiative, so the Round marker is placed blue side up 1 . 3, · PLACE ALL OF THE DICE next to the board. 4, · PLACE ALL REMAINING FLAME, FROST, GAS, SMOKE GRENADE, SHACKLE, AND BROKEN WALL TOKENS in a general supply nearby. These may be required during the game if certain Skills are in play. ADDITIONAL HERO SETUP Most Heroes come with additional components to be placed beside their Bat-Tablets during setup. Where this applies, this is indicated by the Mission, as follows: II E 1 , EQUIPMENT CARDS Where a Hero starts the Mission with one or more items of Equipment, the names of the correspon- ding Equipment cards are written underneath the Hero’s picture on the relevant page of the Missions Booklet. These Equipment cards are placed next to their Bat-Tablet. For example, here, Catwoman starts with the Claws Equipment card. II E 2 , BAT-GADGET CARDS Where the symbol is shown next to a Hero’s pic- ture on the relevant page of the Missions Booklet, that Hero has a utility belt that allows them to carry Bat- Gadgets (see page 24). At this point, the Hero players choose which (and how many) Bat-Gadgets the Hero will carry for the Mission; you may freely choose from all Bat-Gadgets in the game, provided the total combined size of your chosen Bat-Gadgets does not exceed the capacity of the Hero’s utility belt, as shown on their Screen. Bat-Gadgets car- ried by a Hero are placed next to their Bat-Tablet. NOTE: Since the Heroes are working as a team, the Hero players should decide together who should take a parti- cular Bat-Gadget if more than one Hero wants the card. For example, Batman has a utility belt of capacity 4 1 , allowing him to carry Bat-Gadgets with a maximum total combined size of 4. For this Mission, he has chosen the Batarangs (size 1) 2 , Explosive Batarang (size 1) 3 , and Batcape (size 2) 4 , for a total combined size equaling this maximum of 4. II E 3 , HERO ALLY CHARACTER TILES Where the symbol is shown next to a Hero’s pic- ture on the relevant page of the Missions Booklet, that Hero possesses a Command Skill, allowing them to control Hero Ally Characters. The Hero’s Command Skill is either Elite ( X ) or Henchman ( X ), and has a level associated with it as shown on their Screen. Each Hero that has this Skill chooses one Hero Ally Character tile of the corresponding type and places it next to their Bat-Tablet. The Character tile chosen must not be required elsewhere in the Mission’s setup, or already selected by another Hero with the Command Skill. II D , II E , 1 1 2 3 4 1, 2, CLAWS CATWOMAN ","The level of the Command Skill indicates how many miniatures they can control; take this number of miniatures corresponding to the chosen Character tile. Place these miniatures in the same starting Area as their controlling Hero, unless otherwise speci- fied by the Mission. If the corresponding Area would become Over-Occupied (see Occupation Limit on page 34) with these miniatures, place the excess over the Area’s Occupation limit in any Adjacent Area(s) of your choice (Adjacent Areas are separated by a White or Orange boundary; see page 16). If a Hero possesses more than one Command Skill on their Screen, repeat this process with a different Character tile for each such Skill. For example, Renee Montoya’s Screen indicates she has a Henchman Command Skill of level 3 1 , allowing her to control 3 miniatures from 1 Henchman Hero Ally Character tile, such as the GCPD Officers (with Baton) 2 . 1 2 "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || MISSION STRUCTURE 15 III . MISSION STRUCTURE Each Mission is played over a number of rounds. During each round, the Heroes’ side and the Villain’s side will take one turn each. In each round, the side with the Initiative (as specified by the Mission) takes the first turn, followed by the other side. A TURN FOR THE HEROES consists of the Hero players working together to perform actions with their Heroes via their Bat-Tablets in any order and as many times as they want and are able to. For example, they may select a Hero to per - form any number of actions before play passes to another Hero, who again performs any number of actions, before passing to any other Hero (which may be one who has already performed actions this round). The Heroes’ turn continues in this way until the Hero players announce they have finished their turn, because they either cannot or do not wish to perform any more actions. ON THE VILLAIN’S TURN, the Villain player activates 0, 1, or 2 tiles on their Command Post to control their miniatures or trigger Events. On the Heroes’ turns, the Villains can- not take any actions; they can only pay for Defense, Rerolls, and trigger defensive Skills, and the same is true for the Heroes during the Villain’s turns. THE GAME ENDS either after a specified number of rounds has been played, or when a victory condition has been met, whichever happens first. The Mission details contain the victory conditions for each side to win the game. ROUND STRUCTURE A round consists of the following phases: UPKEEP TURN OF THE SIDE WITH INITIATIVE TURN OF THE SIDE WITHOUT INITIATIVE III A 1 , UPKEEP Advance the Round Marker Move the Round marker forward one space on the Round track (in the first round of the game, it is moved to the “1” space). Trigger Effects of the Upkeep Phase Some effects are linked to the start of the round. Where applicable, these are specified in the Mission. If the conditions for an effect are fulfilled, the effect is triggered as described in the Mission. If several effects happen at the same time, the side with Initiative chooses the order in which they occur. III A 2 , TURN OF THE SIDE WITH INITIATIVE The Mission indicates which side has Initiative. That side takes their turn first each round, and plays accor- ding to the rules described in their corresponding chapter (Pages 20 (Heroes) & 29 (Villain) and Villain’s Turn on page 15). III A 3 , TURN OF THE SIDE WITHOUT INITIATIVE The side without Initiative now takes their turn, playing according to the rules described in their cor- responding chapter. At the end of the turn of the side without Initiative, the round is over, and the game continues with the start of a new round (return to phase 1, Upkeep, above). END OF THE GAME The Mission specifies a number of end-game condi- tions. If at any point, at least one of these conditions has been met, the game ends immediately. At this point, the winning side is determined according to the victory conditions specified by the Mission.

IMPORTANT TERMS RULES PRIORITY HIERARCHY BATMAN™: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES involves numerous effects due to cards, powers, abilities, and so on. As such, it is possible that some rules may contradict each other. When this occurs, the following priority hierarchy is applied: - 1, · MISSION SPECIAL RULES - 2, · TRAITS - 3, · SKILLS - 4, · GAME RULES HEROES AND NON-HEROES The rules will often refer to miniatures, Heroes, and non-Heroes. A miniature with a Bat-Tablet is a Hero. A miniature with a Character tile is a non-Hero. This includes Villain and Neutral miniatures, but also Hero Ally miniatures such as GCPD Officers. AREAS Each Map consists of a number of Areas which can contain miniatures and other game com- ponents. The precise position where a minia- ture or other component is placed in an Area is not relevant; for the game, it only matters that they are located within a given Area. Unless otherwise stated, the decorative elements of the artwork in an Area are purely illustrative and have no gameplay effect. The colors of the boundaries between Areas deter- mine the rules for Movement and determining Line of Sight. These rules are fully explained in the relevant sections of this rulebook and summarized on pages 6 and 7 of the Missions Booklet. Two Areas are considered Adjacent if the boundary between them is white or orange. For example, Area A is Adjacent to Areas B and C , as indicated by the white and orange boundaries between them, respectively. Areas B and C are not Adjacent to each other since the boundary between them is a Wall (as can be seen on the Map board reference sheet). Areas may also contain various icons indicating their Occupation limit, whether the Area contains Difficult or Dangerous Terrain, and Line of Sight markers. Again, these icons are all explained in the relevant sections of the rulebook and summarized in the Missions Booklet. Finally, each Area is at a particular Elevation level and may be classed as an Obstruction. This is not depic- ted on the Map board but is shown on the Map board reference sheets. These reference sheets also contain information about Jumps, Climbs, and Drops which are ways that miniatures can move between certain Areas. DICE AND SUCCESSES Dice are at the core of BATMAN™: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES. They come in 5 colors (White, Yellow, Orange, Red, and Black), each of which has a different set of faces with each one showing between 0 and 4 Success symbols . The distribution of Successes on each color is as follows: DISTRIBUTION OF SUCCESSES ON DIE FACES WHITE YELLOW ORANGE RED BLACK Many (though not all) actions and other effects in the game require players to roll a combination of dice and count the total number of Successes rolled to determine an outcome. For example, the num- ber of Successes rolled by a player may determine whether or to what extent they are able to carry out their chosen action, or to Defend against an Attack. Full details of when and how dice are to be used are explained in the relevant sections of this rulebook.

Each Hero is controlled with a Bat-Tablet. BAT-TABLET ANATOMY 1, · HERO: The Screen corresponding to the chosen Hero (and showing that Hero’s name and image) is placed into the Bat-Tablet during setup. 2, · ACTION SPACES: These represent the 5 actions the Hero can perform by spending Energy cubes, pla- cing them on the corresponding spaces (see the Actions section on pages 33-46). Each space is asso- ciated with one or more Characteristics (see below), as shown next to each action space on the Hero’s Screen. 2.1, · MELEE ATTACK 2.2, · RANGED ATTACK 2.3, · MANIPULATION 2.4, · THOUGHT 2.5, · MOVEMENT 3, · DEFENSE SPACE: The Hero can Defend themself by spending Energy cubes, placing them on this space. The Characteristics for this space are shown on the Hero’s Screen. 4, · REROLL SPACE: The Hero may Reroll by spending Energy cubes, placing them on this space. The Exertion limit Characteristic for this space is shown on the Hero’s Screen. Characteristics of action, Defense, and Reroll spaces 1 die of the color shown is added to the dice pool for each Energy cube spent on this space. NOTE: The small dots to the side of the die cor- respond to the relative strengths of the different colored dice; White dice have 1 dot, Yellow 2, Orange 3, Red 4, and Black 5 dots. If the icon has an arrow symbol on it, this allows for 1 Free Reroll of a single die of the color shown for each Energy cube spent on the corresponding action or Defense (at most one Free Reroll per die). See page 50 for more details. No dice are added to the pool when Energy cubes are spent on this space. V A , THE HEROES ","This icon shows the Move Point multiplier (how many Move Points are gained for each Energy cube spent when taking a Movement action). Exertion limit: Each space has an Exertion limit associated with it which is indicated by X next to the word “MAX”. The Exertion limit is the maximum number of cubes the space can contain. 5, · RESERVE ZONE: When the Hero spends Energy cubes, they are taken from this zone. 6, · FATIGUE ZONE: At the start and end of the Heroes’ turn, all spent Energy cubes are moved to this zone. A certain number of these cubes are recove- red each round. 7, · WOUND ZONE: When the Hero is Wounded, the cor- responding number of Energy cubes are moved to this zone. Some of these cubes may be recovered to the Fatigue Zone in future rounds. 8, · SKILLS: Each Hero has a combination of Skills that allow them to perform actions with improved efficiency. Each Skill is represented by a hexa- gon-shaped icon and has a corresponding Skill level, which determines how powerful the Skill is. Some Skills depict an Encumbrance threshold X indicating that the Skill cannot be used if the Hero is carrying too much Equipment. When a Hero’s Encumbrance level is at or above this threshold, they cannot use the corresponding Skill. If an Encumbrance threshold is not shown, there is no such restriction. For example, this is a level 1 Martial Arts Skill 1 . The Hero possessing it can only use the Skill if their Encumbrance total is less than the threshold of 4 2 , i.e., when they have an Encumbrance of 0 to 3. 9, · TRAIT: Where shown, this is an important part of the Hero which impacts their actions. 10, · HERO’S ENERGY: The total number of Energy cubes available to the Hero. 11, · RECOVERY VALUES: Indicates the number of Energy cubes recovered by the Hero during the Declare Heroes’ Stances step each round, depending on whether they are Active or Resting. A Stance marker is placed on the Screen to indicate the chosen Stance and the corresponding Recovery Value. 12, · ENCUMBRANCE TABLE: Indicates the Hero’s First Movement Bonus, based on their total Encumbrance (the total load from the Equipment cards they are carrying; Bat-Gadgets do not add to Encumbrance). The Hero can never exceed the Encumbrance value on the far right in this table. For example, this Hero’s Encumbrance table shows the following: 1 · Their First Movement Bonus is 2 as long as their Encumbrance total is less than 4. 2 · Their First Movement Bonus reduces to 1 if their Encumbrance total is 4 or 5. 3 · If their Encumbrance total is at 6, they have no First Movement Bonus. The Hero can never exceed a total Encumbrance of 6. 13, · UTILITY BELT CAPACITY: The maximum combined size of Bat-Gadgets the Hero can carry, if any (see page 22). 14, · SIZE INDEX: The size of the Hero, used when evalua- ting some effects, such as Hindering or Occupation limits during Movement. 15, · MENACE INDEX: How much of a threat the Hero pre- sents to their enemies; used when evaluating some effects, such as Hindering during Ranged Attack, Complex Manipulation, or Complex Thought actions. 16, · AUTOMATIC DEFENSE: The type of Defense bonus (if any) possessed by the Hero. 17, · MOVE POINT MULTIPLIER: The number of Move Points gained for each Energy cube spent when moving. 1 1 2 2 3 ","HEROES’ TURN The Heroes’ turn consists of the following steps: MOVE SPENT ENERGY CUBES TRIGGER THE START OF THE HEROES’ TURN EFFECTS DECLARE HEROES’ STANCES HERO ACTIONS TRIGGER THE END OF THE HEROES’ TURN EFFECTS MOVE SPENT ENERGY CUBES V B 1 , MOVE SPENT ENERGY CUBES All Energy cubes spent by the Heroes during the Villain’s turn (on Defense and Rerolls) are moved to the corresponding Heroes’ Fatigue Zones.

A Neutralized Hero (see page 49) must be set to a Resting Stance. Then, for each Hero, the number of Energy cubes indi - cated by the arrow on their Stance marker are moved from their Fatigue Zone to their Reserve Zone. If there are not enough Energy cubes in the Fatigue Zone, the remaining number, where available, are moved from their Wound Zone to their Fatigue Zone. Example 1: The Hero is Active, and their Stance marker indi- cates they can recover 2 Energy cubes 1 . Since there are enough cubes in the Fatigue Zone, both are moved from the Fatigue Zone to the Reserve Zone 2 . Example 2: The Hero is Resting, and their Stance marker indi- cates they can recover 6 Energy cubes 1 . Since there are only 2 in the Fatigue Zone, those 2 are moved into the Reserve Zone 2 and the remaining 4 are moved from the Wound Zone to the Fatigue Zone 3 . An Active Hero is free to perform as many actions as they wish during their turn, as long as they have enough Energy cubes available to do so and are within the Exertion limits of their action spaces. A Resting Hero can only perform certain Free Actions (Counterattack or Retaliation), Rerolls, and Defenses, or drop Equipment cards. Once chosen in this step, each Hero’s Stance lasts until the start of the Heroes’ turn in the next round (including during the following Villain’s turn). V B 4 , HERO ACTIONS The Heroes do not act in a set order; instead, the Hero players have the freedom to coordinate the actions of their Heroes as they wish. The Hero players decide which Hero will act next (and become the Acting Hero). The Hero chosen must have an Active Stance and be able to perform an action. The Acting Hero may then perform one or more of the 5 available actions. The Hero players declare which action to perform first, and then carry out that action (see the Actions section on pages 33-46). After having done so, they may perform another action with the Acting Hero in the same way, or choose a different Active Hero to perform an action. If all of the Heroes are Resting, or the Hero players are unable to or do not wish to perform any further actions with Active Heroes, they proceed to the next step. V B 5 , TRIGGER THE END OF THE HEROES’ TURN EFFECTS Some effects are linked to the end of the Heroes’ turn. Where applicable, these are specified by Mission spe- cial rules. If the conditions for an effect are fulfilled, the effect is triggered. If several effects happen at the same time, the Hero players decide the order in which they occur.

Most cards convey bonuses to the Hero using them, while some relate to specific items relevant for some Missions. V C 1 , EQUIPMENT AND BAT-GADGET CARD ANATOMY 1, · NAME: The name of the item. 2, · ENCUMBRANCE VALUE OF THE EQUIPMENT / SIZE OF THE BAT- GADGET: This represents the size of the burden on a Hero carrying the Equipment card, or the space the Bat-Gadget takes up in a Hero’s utility belt. 3, · ARTWORK: A depiction of the item. 4, · TYPE OF ITEM: There are 4 different types of Equipment or Bat-Gadget, as follows: OBJECT: These represent various items used in some Missions, the rules for which are specified in corresponding Missions. TOOL: These are items with various bonuses for a Hero who carries them. Some Tool cards can be used to enhance Manipulation or Thought actions. MELEE WEAPON: These weapons can be used to enhance Melee Attack actions. RANGED WEAPON: These weapons allow Heroes to perform Ranged Attack actions. 5, · USE RESTRICTION: Some cards restrict which Heroes can benefit from their bonuses and/or how many times they can be used, as follows: U S E R NAMED HERO: If there is a Hero’s name on an Equipment card, only that specific Hero may benefit from its bonuses. NOTE: This restriction does not appear on Bat-Gadgets. LETHAL ITEM: Where this icon is shown, it indi- cates that this is a Lethal item, and so Heroes with the Moral Code Trait cannot benefit from the card’s bonuses. ONE-TIME USE: Where this icon is shown, it indicates that the card can only be used once; when a Hero carrying one of these cards has benefited from at least one of its bonuses, immediately remove the card from the game. NOTE: These restrictions only determine which Heroes can benefit from the bonuses of these cards. Any Hero may still carry (as well as pick up, give, take, throw, or drop) an Equipment card even if it has a restriction that prevents them using its bonuses. 6, · BONUS LINE: Most Equipment and Bat-Gadget cards depict one or more bonus lines. Each bonus line is made up of icons that denote the bonus(es) a Hero gains from using the card. If there is more than one bonus line, only one bonus line on each card may be used during a single action.

If the Hero already has this Trait, the bonus has no additional effect. V C 2 , EQUIPMENT CARDS Carrying and Using Equipment Only Heroes controlled with a Bat-Tablet can carry and use Equipment. Any such Hero can carry (as well as pick up, give, take, throw, or drop) any Equipment card, provided they do not exceed their Encumbrance limit (see below). Any Equipment card(s) carried by a Hero are placed next to their Bat-Tablet. In order to use (i.e., benefit from the bonuses of) an Equipment card, a Hero must be carrying it. NOTE: As mentioned earlier, some Equipment cards have restrictions preventing certain Heroes from benefiting from their bonuses; however, these restrictions do not stop those Heroes from carrying them. A Hero’s total Encumbrance is the total of the Encumbrance values of the Equipment cards they are carrying. This can never exceed the Hero’s Encumbrance limit, as shown by the Encumbrance table on their Screen. Remember that a Hero’s Encumbrance also deter- mines their First Movement Bonus. Some Skills also have Encumbrance thresholds; where this is the case, a Hero can only benefit from the corresponding Skill while their total Encumbrance is lower than the Skill’s Encumbrance threshold. For example, Commissioner Gordon carries a Tonfa and a Submachine Gun, bringing his total Encumbrance to 5 1 . With an Encumbrance of 5, Commissioner Gordon’s First Movement Bonus is 1 2 . He cannot use his Retaliation Skill 3 because his Encumbrance total is not lower than 5. Picking up Equipment An Acting Hero may pick up an Equipment card if they are located in the same Area as the card, as long as their Encumbrance limit would not be exceeded by picking it up. Picking up a single Equipment card is an Automatic Manipulation action (see page 41). During the Apply the Automatic Manipulation step of the action, the controlling player takes the corres- ponding Equipment card from the Area and places it next to the Hero’s Bat-Tablet.

Transferring a single Equipment card by giving it to or taking it from another Hero is an Automatic Manipulation action (see page 41). During the Spend Energy Cube step of the action, only the Acting Hero spends an Energy cube. During the Apply the Automatic Manipulation step, the controlling player takes the corresponding Equipment card from next to the Bat-Tablet of the Hero currently carrying it and places it next to the receiving Hero’s Bat-Tablet. Throwing Equipment An Acting Hero may throw an Equipment card they are carrying to a target Area of the Map which they have Line of Sight to. Throwing a single Equipment card is a Complex Manipulation action (see page 42). The Difficulty of the Complex Manipulation is equal to the Distance from the Hero’s Area to the target Area, where the Distance is the minimum number of Moves that separate the two Areas, ignoring Move Cost and Elevation. During the Calculate the Number of Successes step, the Encumbrance value of the thrown Equipment is subtracted from the number of Successes obtained in addition to subtracting the Hindering Modifier. This cannot reduce the number of Successes below zero. During the Apply the Complex Manipulation step: - If the Complex Manipulation is successful, the controlling player takes the thrown Equipment card from next to the Hero’s Bat-Tablet and places it in the target Area. - If the Complex Manipulation is unsuccessful, the throw has fallen short of its target Area. The controlling player takes the thrown Equipment card from next to the Hero’s Bat-Tablet and places it in an Area that is at a Distance equal to the resul - ting number of Successes along the Line of Sight from the Hero’s Area towards the target Area. If there is more than one possible Area at this Distance, the player controlling the Hero chooses which to place it in. NOTE: If the resulting number of Successes is zero, the Hero has still thrown the card and they are no longer carrying it, but it has not travelled any Distance; it is placed in the Hero’s Area. For example, Batman A is carrying a Medikit and wants to throw it to the Area that Commissioner Gordon is in B . The Distance between the two Areas is 3, which sets the Difficulty of the Complex Manipulation 1 . Batman chooses to spend 2 Energy cubes 2 and rolls 2 Orange dice, getting 3 Successes 3 . The Encumbrance value of the Medikit (1) is deducted from the number of Successes, reducing the total to 2 Successes 4 , indi- cating that the action is unsuccessful, and the throw has fallen short. Therefore, Batman places the Medikit in Area C . Dropping Equipment A Hero may drop an Equipment card they are carrying at any time (including at the start of the game, while they are Neutralized or Resting, or during Movement, another Hero’s turn, or even the Villain’s turn). Dropping Equipment is not an action and does not require the spending of any Energy cubes. When a Hero drops an Equipment card, it is taken from next to the Hero’s Bat- Tablet and placed in the Area of the Map that the Hero is located in. V C 3 , BAT-GADGET CARDS Heroes with the utility belt symbol on their Screen have a utility belt that allows them to carry Bat-Gadgets. During setup, the Hero players choose which Bat-Gadget cards the correspon- ding Heroes will carry for the Mission. Any such Hero may carry any combination of Bat-Gadgets, provided the total combined size of the Bat-Gadgets they are carrying does not exceed the capacity of their utility belt, as shown on their Screen. Bat-Gadgets carried by a Hero are placed next to their Bat-Tablet. They work in the same way as Equipment cards, with the following exceptions: - Bat-Gadgets do not have Encumbrance values and do not affect the Encumbrance of a Hero. - Unlike Equipment cards, Bat-Gadget cards cannot be picked up, given, taken, thrown, or dropped.

COMMAND POST AND TILE ANATOMY VI A 1 , THE COMMAND POST NOTE: During Mission setup, various tiles are placed in the Command Post. The tiles that go in the top half of the Command Post are gray on one side and blue on the other; the Villain player should use the gray sides. 1, · RESERVE ZONE: When the Villain player spends Energy cubes, they are taken from this zone. 2, · FATIGUE ZONE: At the start of the Villain’s turn, spent Energy cubes are moved to this zone. A certain number of these cubes are recovered each round. 3, · RECOVERY VALUE: The number of Energy cubes reco- vered each round, at the start of the Villain’s turn. 4, · MOVEMENT SPACE: Villains may spend Energy cubes (placing them on this space) to gain addi- tional Move Points. The Move Point multiplier (how many Move Points are gained for each Energy cube spent when taking a Movement action) is indicated by this icon. 5, · DEFENSE SPACE: Villains can Defend themselves by spending Energy cubes, placing them on this space. They add 1 die of the color shown by this icon to the dice pool for each Energy cube spent on this space. 6, · REROLL SPACE: Villains may Reroll by spending Energy cubes, placing them on this space. Exertion limit of Movement, Defense, and Reroll spaces THE EXERTION LIMIT (the maximum number of cubes the space can contain) is indicated by this number. This is also reflected in the number of available cube slots in the corresponding space in the Command Post. 7, · LIFE POINT TRACK: Tracks the physical state of the Villain miniatures who have a Life Point value grea- ter than 1. 8, · THE RIVER: The row containing the Event Warning tile and Character tiles which are available to acti- vate during the Villain’s turns. 9, · TILE ACTIVATION COSTS: The cost, in Energy cubes, of activating a tile is marked above the tile’s position in the River.

They are usually controlled by the Villain player using the Command Post. NOTE: Heroes with the Command Skill can also control miniatures with Character tiles. 1, · NAME: The name and image of the miniature repre- sented by the Character tile. 2, · SIDE: The color of a tile determines its standard allegiance; gray for the Villains, blue for Hero Allies (which are the only tiles a Hero with the Command Skill can recruit), and orange for Neutral civilians. 3, · LIFE POINTS: The number of Life Points each minia- ture controlled by the tile has. Most miniatures only have 1 Life Point. Those with more than 1 have a cor- responding Life Point marker which is used on the Command Post to track their current Life Points. 4, · AUTOMATIC DEFENSE: The number of Automatic Defense Successes attributed to a corresponding miniature during Defense. 5, · FIRST MOVEMENT BONUS: The number of Move Points the miniature gains the first time they are moved when activated. 6, · SIZE INDEX: The size of a corresponding minia- ture, used when evaluating some effects, such as Hindering or Occupation limits during Movement. 7, · MENACE INDEX: How much of a threat a correspon- ding miniature presents to their enemies; used when evaluating some effects, such as Hindering during Ranged Attack, Complex Manipulation, or Complex Thought actions. 8, · TRAIT: Where shown, this is an important part of a corresponding miniature which impacts their actions. 9, · ACTIONS: These represent the actions miniatures can perform when they are activated. Not all actions are available for all miniatures. Each action is asso- ciated with one or more Characteristics (see below), as shown on the Character tiles. 9.1, · MELEE ATTACK 9.2, · RANGED ATTACK 9.3, · MANIPULATION 9.4, · THOUGHT Characteristics of Actions Dice of the quantity and color(s) shown are added to the dice pool when per- forming the corresponding action. X indicates the action multiplier (the number of times a miniature may perform the action whenever they choose that action). This indicates a choice between diffe- rent sets of dice to add to the dice pool (and an associated action multiplier, X). The Villain player chooses one of these each time a corresponding miniature is activated. This icon indicates 1 Free Reroll of a single die of the color shown (at most 1 Free Reroll per die). See page 50 for more details. Where no Characteristic is shown by an action, the miniature is only able to perform the action if they possess a corresponding Skill that confers one, or if the Mission special rules grant them one. An action with this Characteristic cannot be performed by the miniature under any circumstances, even if they have a corres- ponding Skill or the Mission special rules grant them one. "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || THE VILLAINS 28 For example, Deadshot has 2 options for Ranged Attacks: he can either use a dice pool of 1 Yellow, 1 Orange, and 1 Red die, each with a Free Reroll, but only attack once each time he is activated 1 ; or he can use 2 Yellow dice with 1 Free Reroll for up to 3 consecutive Attacks in a sin- gle activation 2 . For example, Carnivorous Plants cannot perform any Ranged Attack actions at all 1 , so while in general the Poison Skill 2 can be applied to all Attacks, they can only use it during their Melee Attacks 3 . With no Manipulation Characteristic 4 , the only Manipulation actions they can perform are by using their Attraction Skill 5 . 10, · SKILLS: Most non-Hero miniatures have one or more Skills that allow them to perform actions with improved efficiency. Each Skill is represented by a hexagon-shaped icon and has a corresponding Skill level, which determines how powerful the Skill is. Skills are described in detail in Skills & Traits Booklet. 11, · REINFORCEMENT COST: Represents the number of Reinforcement Points required to bring a corres- ponding miniature from the Character Pool into play (see Reinforcement on page 31). A tile without a Reinforcement cost indicates that those miniatures cannot be brought back into play in this way. 12, · TYPE OF THE TILE: Indicates the type of the correspon- ding miniature(s). This is relevant for Heroes with Command Skills (which only allow them to control Hero Allies of a specific type), and Demobilization (which the Villain player can only perform with Elite or Henchman non-Heroes). Types of Character Tile LEADER/ LIEUTENANT ELITE HENCHMAN Double-sized Tiles Double-sized Character tiles work in the same way as the standard ones, except that they occupy two positions in the River.

VI B 1 , MOVE SPENT ENERGY CUBES All Energy cubes on the Movement, Defense, and Reroll spaces of the Command Post are returned to the Fatigue Zone. Then, a number of Energy cubes corresponding to the Mission’s Recovery Value are moved from the Fatigue Zone to the Reserve Zone. First, all Energy cubes spent on Movement, Defense, and Rerolls since the start of the previous Villain’s turn are moved to the Fatigue Zone. Then, in this case the Recovery Value tile shows 5 1 , so 5 cubes are moved from the Fatigue Zone to the Reserve Zone 2 . VI B 2 , TRIGGER THE START OF THE VILLAIN’S TURN EFFECTS Some effects are linked to the start of the Villain’s turn. Where applicable, these are specified by relevant Skills and Mission special rules. If the conditions for an effect are fulfilled, the effect is triggered. If seve- ral such effects happen in the same round, the Villain player decides the order in which they occur. VI B 3 , ACTIVATE 0, 1, OR 2 TILES In this step, the Villain player may activate up to 2 tiles of their choice from the River. If they choose to activate 0 tiles, they skip the rest of this step and proceed to step 4. If they choose to activate 1 or 2 tiles, they first fol- low the steps a-c below for the first tile they activate. Then, after fully completing their first activation, they may choose to activate a second tile. They do not need to declare which tile they will activate second until the first activation is complete. The same tile may be activated twice in the same turn. For each tile they activate, complete the following steps: DECLARE A TILE TO ACTIVATE AND SPEND ENERGY CUBES MOVE THE TILE TO THE END OF THE RIVER ACTIVATE THE TILE’S MINIATURE(S) / TRIGGER EVENT Declare a Tile to Activate and Spend Energy Cubes The Villain player chooses a tile from the River with an activation cost equal to or lower than the number of Energy cubes in the Reserve Zone of the Command Post. The activation cost of a tile is indicated by the number on the Command Post above the tile’s position in the River (or in the case of a double-sized tile, above its cost indicator). They spend Energy cubes equal to the tile’s activation cost, by moving them from the Reserve Zone to the Fatigue Zone on the Command Post For example, the Villain player chooses to activate Killer Croc’s tile 1 , which is in the third position of the River and therefore has an activation cost of 3 Energy cubes. They move 3 cubes from their Reserve Zone to their Fatigue Zone 2 .

NOTE: If there are fewer than 8 tiles in the River, any empty spaces should remain to the right of all tiles at the end of this step. The Villain player places the activated tile at the end of the River 1 , sliding tiles to the left to fill the gap 2 . Activate the Tile’s Miniature(s) / Trigger Event If the Villain player activated a Character tile, they may activate any number (including 0) of the corres- ponding miniatures once each. The activation of one of the tile’s miniatures must be completed before star- ting the activation of another. Each activation follows the rules under Activate a Miniature Controlled by a Tile on page 31. If the Villain player activated the Event Warning tile, they may carry out any one of the Events as descri- bed by the Mission. When carrying out an Event with more than one part to it, unless otherwise specified, they may choose the order in which to carry out those parts. Many Events include gaining a number of Reinforcement Points; details of how to use these are under Reinforcement on page 31. NOTE: If the activated tile is showing its Neutralized side face up (see page 49 for Neutralization), the tile activation ends immedia- tely, without any further effects. This still counts as 1 tile activation. VI B 4 , TRIGGER THE END OF THE VILLAIN’S TURN EFFECTS Some effects are linked to the end of the Villain’s turn. Where applicable, these are specified by Mission spe- cial rules. If the conditions for an effect are fulfilled, the effect is triggered.

Activating each miniature is optional and it is allowed to activate none. When a miniature is acti- vated, that activation must be completed before starting the activation of another. For each miniature activated, the Villain player per- forms the following steps: DESIGNATE A MINIATURE FIRST MOVEMENT PERFORM AN ACTION OTHER THAN MOVEMENT SECOND MOVEMENT VI C 1 , DESIGNATE A MINIATURE The Villain player chooses a corresponding miniature that has not yet been activated during the current Character tile activation. VI C 2 , FIRST MOVEMENT They may perform a Movement action with the minia- ture (see page 33). If they do, the miniature’s First Movement Bonus (which applies to each miniature for their first Movement each time they are activated) is added to their Move Point Pool. VI C 3 , PERFORM AN ACTION OTHER THAN MOVEMENT The miniature may perform up to one action other than Movement. This can be one of the following: - MELEE ATTACK (see page 37) - RANGED ATTACK (see page 39) - MANIPULATION (see page 41) - THOUGHT (see page 44) For example, after activating the Killer Croc Character tile, the Villain player activates Killer Croc and decides not to move, and to attack the Heroes in his Area instead. If they perform an action with more than 1 Characteristic (indicated by X X on the Character tile), they may only choose 1 Characteristic to use for this activation. If the action they choose is associated with an action multiplier (indicated by a number in the Character tile’s Characteristic for the chosen action), they may perform the action up to the number of times indicated. For example, an activated miniature with this Characteristic may perform 2 successive Melee Attack actions, each with 2 White dice and 1 Yellow die. VI C 4 , SECOND MOVEMENT They may perform a Movement action. If they do, and the miniature did not move in the First Movement step of this activation (see step 2 above), the miniature’s First Movement Bonus is added to their Move Point Pool, i.e., the First Movement Bonus applies to each miniature the first time they move each activation, whether it be in step 2 or step 4. REINFORCEMENT Reinforcement Points may be gained and spent by the Villain player after activating the Event Warning tile. The number of Reinforcement Points granted by an Event depends on the specific Event triggered, as specified by the Mission’s rules. Reinforcement Points may be spent to bring miniatures from the Character Pool into play as Reinforcements. The cost of doing so, in Reinforcement Points per minia- ture, is shown in the bottom right of the corresponding Character tile. If there is no Reinforcement cost shown on a Character tile, Reinforcement cannot be used to bring its corresponding miniature(s) back into play. For example, a miniature corresponding to a Character tile showing this would cost 2 Reinforcement Points to bring into play from the Character Pool. The Villain player may bring in as many Reinforcements as they wish and have sufficient Reinforcement Points to afford. For each miniature they take from the Character Pool, they deduct its Reinforcement cost from their available Reinforcement Points and place it in any Reinforcement Area (one containing a face-up Reinforcement token) that has space for VI C , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , VI D , ","6 1 1 1 2 1 6 it; a Reinforced miniature may not cause the Area they are placed in to be Over-Occupied. If all avai- lable Reinforcement Areas would be Over-Occupied by its placement, the Villain player places the minia- ture in an Area of their choice which is Adjacent to an available Reinforcement Area (i.e., separated from one by a white or orange boundary) and that itself is not Over-Occupied by this placement. If all such Adjacent Areas would be Over-Occupied, the miniature cannot be brought in as a Reinforcement. If the Villain player Reinforces a miniature correspon- ding to a Neutralized Character tile (see Neutralization on page 49), they flip the tile face up, preserving its position in the River on the Command Post. After the Villain player has carried out as many Reinforcements as they wish or are able to, any remai - ning unspent Reinforcement Points are lost. For example, this Area has an Occupation limit of 6 1 . In the Area at the moment are Batman and 3 Thugs (each with a Size Index of 1) and Bane (Venom Injected) (Size Index 2) 2 . The Villain player may not Reinforce into this Area and must choose a different Reinforcement Area 3 . If all Reinforcement Areas are fully occupied, the Villain player may instead Reinforce into an Area Adjacent to a Reinforcement Area (as long as that does not cause it to be Over-Occupied). Character Pool The Character Pool represents the miniatures that the Villain player can use as Reinforcements. Unless otherwise indicated, the Character Pool contains 0 miniatures at the start of a Mission. Miniatures may then be placed into the Character Pool when they are Neutralized, or if applicable as specified by a Mission’s special rules. DREDGING THE RIVER At any point during the Villain’s turn, the Villain player may Dredge the River by removing one or more Neutralized Character tiles (see Neutralization on page 49) and placing them back in the game box, along with any corresponding miniatures. The miniatures of a tile thus removed cannot be brought back into play, even during Reinforcement. Each Character tile Dredged from the River costs 2 Energy cubes, which are also returned to the box. These cubes must be taken from the Command Post’s Fatigue Zone if possible; however if there are not enough cubes in the Fatigue Zone, the Villain player may remove the remaining cube(s) from the Movement, Defense and/or Reroll spaces (in any com- bination of their choice), and finally from the Reserve Zone if there are still insufficient cubes elsewhere. After Dredging the River, slide any remaining tiles to the left to fill any gaps. There is no limit to the number of Neutralized tiles that the Villain player may Dredge from the River, as long as they have enough Energy cubes to do so. Dredging the River is not an action and does not count as activating a tile. DEMOBILIZATION Once per game, at any point during their turn, the Villain player may Demobilize an Elite or Henchman Character tile. To do this, they select an Elite or Henchman Character tile they wish to remove from the game, flip it to its Neutralized side and remove its corresponding minia- tures from the Map. Then, they Dredge the River of this tile as described above. The cost of Demobilizing a Character tile is the same as the cost for Dredging (i.e., 2 Energy cubes remo- ved from the game); there is no additional cost for Demobilization. Demobilization is not an action and does not count as activating a tile. VI E , VI F , 1 3 2 "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || ACTIONS 33 VII .

Where there are differences between Heroes and non-He- roes, the rules pertaining to the differences are marked accordingly. The “active miniature” refers to the miniature performing the action. References to moving Energy cubes between zones and/or spaces refer to those on the corresponding Bat-Tablet when the active miniature is a Hero, and to those on the Command Post when the active miniature is controlled by the Villain. NOTE: For miniatures controlled by the Command Skill, see Skills & Traits Booklet. MOVEMENT This action consists of one or more Moves, using Move Points taken from the active miniature’s Move Point Pool and/or gained by spending Energy cubes, via the following steps: CREATE THE MOVE POINT POOL CHOOSE DESTINATION AREA AND DETERMINE MOVE TYPE CALCULATE THE MOVE COST SPEND MOVE POINTS AND/OR ENERGY CUBES MOVE THE MINIATURE APPLY THE EFFECTS OF THE DESTINATION AREA NEW MOVE END THE MOVEMENT VII A 1 , CREATE THE MOVE POINT POOL A miniature’s Move Point Pool is based on any First Movement Bonus, plus any bonuses conferred by Skills, Traits, or the Mission’s special rules.

The First Movement Bonus depends on the Hero’s Encumbrance and is shown in the Encumbrance table on the Hero’s Screen. For example, this Hero has a First Movement Bonus of: 2 when they have Encumbrance of 3 or lower 1 ; 1 with Encumbrance of 4 or 5 2 ; and 0 if they are at their Encumbrance limit of 6 3 . NON-HEROES: The first time during an activation that a non-Hero performs the Movement action, their First Movement Bonus is added to their Move Point Pool. The First Movement Bonus is shown on the minia- ture’s Character tile. For example, this miniature has a First Movement Bonus of 3.

For each such Move, follow steps 2-6 below. This continues until the Move Point Pool is empty or the controlling player does not wish to move the miniature any more, at which point the action ends and the Move Point Pool is reset to 0. VII A 2 , CHOOSE DESTINATION AREA AND DETERMINE MOVE TYPE The controlling player chooses an Area of the Map for the miniature to move into that is directly accessible by one of the Move types described below. Note that a miniature cannot enter an Area if by doing so they would cause the Area to be Over-Occupied (see box), even if the miniature would subsequently move out of that Area as part of the same Movement action. Occupation Limit Each Area can only accommodate a limited combined size of miniatures. The total combined size of the miniatures present in an Area is calculated by adding up each miniature’s Size Index; this can never exceed the Area’s Occupation limit, indicated on the Map by the number inside the Occupation limit icon. An Area can never be Over-Occupied. For example, this Area is currently occupied by miniatures 1 with total Size Indexes of 5 2 . It can contain additional min- iatures with combined Size Indexes of 5 before reaching its Occupation limit of 10 3 . There are 4 types of Move, identified by boundary lines, arrows, and icons on the Map board reference sheets: - AN ADJACENT MOVE crosses a single white or orange Area boundary (i.e., into an Adjacent Area), or a Broken Wall token. - X A JUMP is indicated by a pair of black arrows pointing in both directions between 2 Areas and is associated with a level, represented by X in the dia- mond between the arrows. The miniature can Jump in the direction of either arrow. The cost of the Move will be increased by the level of the Jump. - X A CLIMB is indicated by a pair of red arrows pointing in both directions between 2 Areas and is associated with a level, represented by X in the dia- mond between the arrows. The miniature can Climb in the direction of either arrow. The cost of the Move will be increased by the level of the Climb. - X A DROP is indicated by a white arrow pointing in one direction between 2 Areas and is associated with a level, represented by X in the diamond at one end. The miniature can only Drop in the direction of the arrow. A Drop does not increase the cost of the Move; however the higher the level of a Drop, the higher the chances of the miniature being Wounded by it (see step 6 below). NOTES: • If there are multiple Move types possible between the same 2 Areas the controlling player must choose which type to perform. • X Where there are Climb and Drop Moves of the same level between the same 2 Areas, this is represented by a com- bination of red and white arrows. As usual, a Climb can be performed in the direction of either arrow, but a Drop can only be performed in the direction of the white arrow. • The level of a Climb or Drop is typically equal to the difference between the Elevation levels of the corres- ponding Areas. VII A 3 , CALCULATE THE MOVE COST The cost of each individual Move, in Move Points, is calculated as follows: 1 Hindering Modifier of start Area Total level of Difficult Terrain in start Area Jump / Climb level (if applicable) Hindering Movement When moving out of an Area containing enemy minia- tures, the Move Cost is increased by the Hindering Modifier, which is calculated as follows: HINDERING MODIFIER Total Size Indexes of enemy miniatures in the start Area Total Size Indexes of allied miniatures in the start Area (not including the moving miniature) Size Index X NOTES: • Neither the miniature performing the action, nor any Neutralized Hero, is included when calculating the Hindering Modifier. • The Hindering Modifier can never be below zero (if it would be negative, it is considered to be zero). 1 2 3 X "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || ACTIONS 35 Difficult Terrain An Area that contains Difficult Terrain represents ground that is ill-suited for movement, such as ice or a roof. When a miniature moves out of an Area containing Difficult Terrain, their Move Cost is increased by an amount corresponding to the total level of the Difficult Terrain. The total level of Difficult Terrain in an Area is the sum of any and all of the following that are present in the Area: - The Difficult Terrain icon X shown in the Area on the Map board. Its level is represented by X. - Each Frost token in the Area (either side up) adds 1 to the level of the Difficult Terrain in the Area. - Difficult Terrain level may also be modified by an effect of Mission special rules. VII A 4 , SPEND MOVE POINTS AND/OR ENERGY CUBES To move to the chosen Area, the miniature must spend a number of Move Points from their Move Point Pool equal to the Move Cost. If the miniature does not have enough Move Points available, they must spend Energy cubes to increase the number of Move Points they have available in order to carry out the Move (see box below). If they are unable or unwilling to spend Energy cubes, the miniature may choose a different Area to move to (if they have enough Move Points), or the action ends. Spending Energy cubes for additional Move Points During a Movement action, the controlling player may spend Energy cubes to add Move Points to their Move Point Pool. For each Energy cube spent (by moving them from the Reserve Zone to the Movement space), add the number of Move Points indicated by the minia- ture’s Move Point multiplier (shown on the Hero’s Screen or the Movement Space tile on the Villain’s Command Post). The number of cubes spent may not cause them to exceed their Movement Exertion limit. =X HEROES’ MOVE POINT MULTIPLIER =X VILLAIN’S MOVE POINT MULTIPLIER VII A 5 , MOVE THE MINIATURE The controlling player Moves the miniature to the destination Area. VII A 6 , APPLY THE EFFECTS OF THE DESTINATION AREA The effects of any Dangerous Terrain in the destina- tion Area, and/or of a Drop, are applied as follows: - X DANGEROUS TERRAIN: The controlling player totals any Dangerous Terrain values in the destination Area (inclu- ding those from tokens added to the Area by Skills or a Mission’s special rules) and rolls a number of Yellow dice equal to that total. They may attempt to improve the roll by Rerolling. The miniature then suffers as many Wounds as the total number of Successes rolled. See page 53 for the full rules on Dangerous Terrain. - X DROP: If the Move the miniature has just perfor- med was a Drop, the controlling player rolls a number of Yellow dice equal to the level of the Drop (as indi - cated by X in the Drop icon on the Map board reference sheets). They may attempt to improve the roll by Rerolling. The miniature then suffers as many Wounds as the total number of Successes rolled. X "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || ACTIONS A B A B 1/2 A 2 1 3 3 36 MOVEMENT EXAMPLES Example 1 Batman decides to move to attack Bane 1 . He chooses to perform the Movement action and since this is Batman’s first Movement this round, he adds his First Movement Bonus to his Move Point Pool. Because he has a Bulletproof Vest 2 and a Medikit 3 , his Encumbrance is 3, but this is not enough to reduce his First Movement Bonus from its maximum of 2. Therefore his Move Point Pool is 2 4 . To reach Bane, Batman must perform two Moves. MOVE A : This is an Adjacent Move across a white bound- ary. The Move Cost is 2 (the base cost of 1, plus the Hindering Modifier for the presence of the Brute, who has a Size Index of 1). Remember, the moving miniature is not counted when determining the Hindering Modifier. Since Batman has 2 Move Points, he spends them and moves to the next Area. MOVE B : This is another Adjacent Move, but this time Batman is in Difficult Terrain 5 which increases the cost to Move out of an Area by the level of the Difficult Terrain. Therefore, the Move Cost is 2 (the base cost of 1, plus 1 for the Difficult Terrain). NOTE: Batman does possess the Mobility Skill 6 , which can reduce the negative effects of Difficult Terrain. However, as can be seen next to the Skill on his Screen, Batman cannot benefit from this if his Encumbrance value is 3 or higher 7 . If he dropped one of his pieces of Equipment, he would benefit from the Skill, and the Move Cost would be only 1. Batman has no Move Points remaining so must spend 2 Energy cubes to add 2 Move Points to his Move Point Pool if he wants to perform the Move (his Move Point multiplier is 1). He does so, and completes Move B . Example 2 Renee Montoya decides to join in the fight between Batman and Killer Croc 1 . She chooses the Movement action and since this is her first Movement action this round, adds her First Movement Bonus of 2 to her Move Point Pool 2 . Her first MOVE ( A ) is an Adjacent Move 3 , with no Hindering or Difficult Terrain, and costs her 1 Move Point, so she still has 1 Move Point left in her Move Point Pool 4 . Her second MOVE ( B ) however, is either a level 2 Climb or a level 2 Drop, as indi- cated in the corresponding Map board reference sheet 5 . She decides to perform a Climb in order to avoid the possibility of taking Wounds from a Drop. Since there is no Hindering or Difficult Terrain, the cost of the Move is 1 (the base cost) + 2 (for the level 2 Climb) = 3 Move Points. Since she currently has 1 Move Point remaining, she must spend 2 Energy cubes to buy the additional 2 Move Points required (her Move Point multiplier is 1). Her Move Point Pool now contains 3 Move Points, which she immediately spends to pay the cost of the Move and joins Batman and Killer Croc in their Area. NOTE: If she had chosen to Drop instead of Climb, the Move Cost would have only been 1, but she would have had to roll 2 Yellow dice to determine if she was Wounded from the Drop. 1 2 6 7 3 4 5 1 3 2 4 5 "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || ACTIONS 37 MELEE ATTACK This action consists of a single Attack on an enemy in the same Area as, or in some cases an Adjacent Area to, the active miniature. In order to perform this action: - A HERO must have at least one Energy cube in their Reserve Zone and must not be at the Exertion limit of their Melee Attack action space. - A NON-HERO must have an available Melee Attack conferred by a Characteristic or a Skill on their Character tile. REMEMBER: A Hero is a miniature with a Bat-Tablet and a non-Hero is any miniature with a Character tile. NOTE: If a non-Hero miniature is performing a Melee Attack with an action multiplier greater than 1, each Attack is resolved separately, one by one, and a different target may be declared for each Attack. The Attacks do not need to target the same enemy. For example, Killer Croc per- forms a Melee Attack. It has a Characteristic of 2 Yellow dice (with 1 Free Reroll) and an action multiplier of 4, meaning they may attack up to 4 times 1 . Killer Croc chooses to attack Batman first, and after resolving the Attack, chooses to attack Batman again, and then again with the 3 rd Attack. That is enough to Neutralize Batman, so Killer Croc uses his last Attack on Renee Montoya. The controlling player performs the following steps: DECLARE THE TARGET SPEND ENERGY CUBES (HEROES ONLY) AND CREATE THE DICE POOL ADD WEAPON BONUSES (HEROES ONLY) ROLL THE DICE POOL REROLLS CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSES DEFENSE AND WOUNDS VII B 1 , DECLARE THE TARGET They choose the target of the miniature’s Melee Attack. The target must be an enemy miniature either: - in the same Area as the miniature; or - in an Adjacent Area that the miniature would cause to be Over-Occupied if they were to move into it and to which the miniature has Line of Sight. REMINDER: An Adjacent Area is one separated from the miniature’s Area by a white or orange boundary. If there are no valid targets this action cannot be performed. SPEND ENERGY CUBES (HEROES ONLY) AND CREATE THE DICE POOL HERO: The controlling player chooses 1 or more Energy cubes to spend, moving them from the Hero’s Reserve Zone to their Melee Attack action space. The number of cubes spent may not cause the Hero to exceed their Melee Attack Exertion limit. Then, for each Energy cube spent, they take a die of the color indicated by the Hero’s Melee Attack Characteristic on their Screen. Any dice taken collec- tively form the dice pool. For example, each Energy cube spent here (up to a maximum of 3 on this Melee Attack action space) provides 1 Red die to the dice pool. NON-HERO: The controlling player takes the dice indi- cated by the Characteristic chosen for this action, forming the dice pool. For example, this Melee Attack Characteristic provides 1 White die and 1 Orange die to the dice pool.

NOTE: Unlike a Ranged Attack, the Melee Attack action is not affected by Hindering. VII B 7 , DEFENSE AND WOUNDS The target of the Attack must now Defend themselves, and then suffer Wounds, if any (see Defense on page 47). MELEE ATTACK EXAMPLE For example, Commissioner Gordon decides to attack a Thug with Crowbar. The Thug is in the same Area as Commissioner Gordon making them a valid target for a Melee Attack. They decide to spend 2 Energy cubes which provides 2 Orange dice for the dice pool, as shown on Commissioner Gordon’s Screen 1 . Additionally, Commissioner Gordon carries a Tonfa; this grants him a bonus of 1 Yellow die for this Attack, which is added to the dice pool 2 . The player rolls the dice pool. In this case, Commissioner Gordon has no Free Rerolls and the player decides not to buy any. Commissioner Gordon thus gets a total of 3 Successes 3 . The Thug has an Automatic Defense of 1 (as shown by his Character tile) 4 , and the Villain player decides not to spend Energy cubes to Defend further. The 1 Automatic Defense Success is subtracted from Commissioner Gordon’s 3 Attack Successes. Therefore, the Thug with Crowbar suffers 2 Wounds.

VII C 2 , SPEND ENERGY CUBES (HEROES ONLY) AND CREATE THE DICE POOL HERO: The controlling player chooses 1 or more Energy cubes to spend, moving them from the Hero’s Reserve Zone to their Ranged Attack action space. The number of cubes spent may not cause the Hero to exceed their Ranged Attack Exertion limit. Then, for each Energy cube spent, they take a die of the color indicated by the Hero’s Ranged Attack Characteristic on their Screen. Any dice taken collec- tively form the dice pool. For example, each Energy cube spent here (up to a maximum of 3 on this Ranged Attack action space) provides 1 Orange die to the dice pool. NON-HERO: The controlling player takes the dice indi- cated by the Characteristic chosen for this action, forming the dice pool. For example, this Ranged Attack Characteristic provides 1 White die and 1 Yellow die to the dice pool. VII C 3 , ADD WEAPON BONUSES (HEROES ONLY) The controlling player must choose exactly one Ranged Weapon card to use for this Attack. This can be any Bat-Gadget or Equipment card showing the Ranged Weapon symbol which is currently carried by the Hero (and which does not have a use restric- tion applying to them), but only one such card may be used per Ranged Attack action. For the rest of this action, the Hero will benefit from any bonuses confer- red upon them by the Ranged Weapon card used. For details of these bonuses and restrictions, see page 22. .

Then, they subtract the Hindering Modifier from the total. Hindering Ranged Attacks When performing a Ranged Attack from an Area containing enemy miniatures, the number of Successes is reduced by the Hindering Modifier, which is calculated as follows: HINDERING MODIFIER Total Menace Indexes of enemy miniatures in the attacker’s Area Total Menace Indexes of allied miniatures in the attacker’s Area (not including the attacking miniature) Menace Index X NOTES: • Neither the miniature performing the action, nor any Neutralized Hero, is included when calculating the Hindering Modifier. • The Hindering Modifier can never be below zero (if it would be negative, it is considered to be zero). • Hindering cannot reduce the number of Successes below zero. VII C 8 , DEFENSE AND WOUNDS The target of the Attack must now Defend themsel- ves, and then suffer Wounds, if any. RANGED ATTACK EXAMPLE For example, Batman is equipped with Batarangs 1 , and is able to perform a Ranged Attack by throwing the Batarangs at a Brute with Chains. The Brute is in the same Area as Batman 2 , so Batman has Line of Sight and the Brute is a valid target. Batman decides to spend 2 Energy cubes on the Ranged Attack, each Energy cube adding 1 Orange die to the dice pool 3 . The Batarangs grant a bonus of 1 Yellow die for this Attack, which is added to the dice pool, and 1 Free Reroll of a Yellow die 4 . The dice are rolled and get 3 Successes, with none on the Yellow die 5 . The player decides to use the Free Reroll granted by the Batarangs and roll the Yellow die again 6 . This time they get 1 Success, bringing the total to 4 Successes. Since this is a Ranged Attack, it is affected by Hindering. Each of the Brutes has a Menace Index of 1 7 , as does Commissioner Gordon 8 . Batman is excluded from the Hindering Modifier calculation as the attacker. Therefore, the Hindering Modifier is 1 and reduces the number of Successes to 3. The Brute has an Automatic Defense of 2 (as shown by his Character tile) 9 , and the Villain player decides not to spend Energy cubes to Defend further. The 2 Automatic Defense Successes are subtracted from Batman’s 3 Attack Successes and the Brute with Chains suffers 1 Wound.

There are two types of Manipulation: Automatic and Complex. In order to perform this action: - A HERO must have at least one Energy cube in their Reserve Zone and must not be at the Exertion limit of their Manipulation action space. - A NON-HERO must have an available Manipulation conferred by a Characteristic or a Skill on their Character tile. REMEMBER: A Hero is a miniature with a Bat-Tablet and a non-Hero is any miniature with a Character tile. VII D 1 , AUTOMATIC MANIPULATION Automatic Manipulations represent actions where the outcome is certain, such as pushing a lever, or (Heroes only) picking up or exchanging Equipment cards with other Heroes. The controlling player performs the following steps: DECLARE AN AUTOMATIC MANIPULATION SPEND ENERGY CUBE (HEROES ONLY) APPLY THE AUTOMATIC MANIPULATION Declare an Automatic Manipulation They specify the single action being performed with the Automatic Manipulation. This may only be one of the following: - Perform an Automatic Manipulation specified by one of the Skills possessed by the miniature. - Perform an Automatic Manipulation specified by the Mission. - Heroes only: Pick up an Equipment card in the same Area. See page 23. - Heroes only: Give an Equipment card to, or take one from, another Hero in the same Area. See page 24.

See page 24. Then, they determine the Difficulty of the action being attempted. The applicable value or calculation required is specified by the rules pertaining to the type of Complex Manipulation chosen. Spend Energy Cubes (Heroes only) and Create the Dice Pool HERO: The controlling player spends 1 or more Energy cubes, moving them from the Hero’s Reserve Zone to their Manipulation action space. The number of cubes spent may not cause the Hero to exceed their Manipulation Exertion limit. Then, for each Energy cube spent, they take a die of the color indicated by the Hero’s Manipulation Characteristic on their Screen. Any dice taken collec- tively form the dice pool. For example, spending 2 Energy cubes on this Manipulation action space adds 2 Yellow dice to the dice pool as well as Free Rerolls of up to 2 Yellow dice. NON-HERO: The controlling player takes the dice indi- cated by the Characteristic chosen for this action, forming the dice pool. For example, this Manipulation Characteristic provides 1 Black die to the dice pool. Add Tool Bonuses (Heroes only) If the Hero is carrying any Tool cards (Bat-Gadget and/or Equipment cards showing the Tool symbol ) which confer upon them bonuses applicable to the Complex Manipulation being attempted, the control- ling player may apply these bonuses. They may apply bonuses from more than one different Tool card at the same time (although it is not allowed to combine the bonuses from identical Tool cards); the Hero will benefit from them for the rest of this action. For details of these bonuses, see page 22. Roll the Dice Pool The controlling player rolls the dice pool. Rerolls They may attempt to improve the roll by Rerolling (see page 50). Calculate the Number of Successes Count the number of Successes shown on all dice rolled (after any Rerolls, if applicable), add any applicable Automatic Successes conferred by Skills the miniature possesses, and apply any other appli- cable modifiers (such as the Encumbrance value when throwing Equipment).

Unless otherwise specified, the miniature’s Manipulation action ends without applying further effects. Hindering Complex Manipulations When performing a Complex Manipulation in an Area containing enemy miniatures, the number of Successes is reduced by the Hindering Modifier, which is calculated as follows: HINDERING MODIFIER Total Menace Indexes of enemy miniatures in the Area Total Menace Indexes of allied miniatures in the Area (not including the acting miniature) Menace Index X NOTES: • Neither the miniature performing the action, nor any Neutralized Hero, is included when calculating the Hindering Modifier. • The Hindering Modifier can never be below zero (if it would be negative, it is considered to be zero). • Hindering cannot reduce the number of Successes below zero. Apply the Complex Manipulation The controlling player carries out the chosen action, applying its effects. COMPLEX MANIPULATION EXAMPLE For example, the special rules of the Mission indicate that a Hero in the same Area as the Safe may try to open it and retrieve its contents by attempting a Complex Manipulation with a Difficulty of 3 1 . If successful, the Hero opens the Safe and may add its contents to the items they carry, if they wish and are able to. The player controlling Batman declares they are attempting to open the Safe and spends 3 Energy cubes on the Manipulation, and accordingly forms the dice pool with 3 Orange dice, as shown on Batman’s Screen 2 . The player rolls the dice pool and gets 3 Success symbols 3 . In this case, no dice can be Rerolled for free, and the player decides not to buy any Rerolls. Complex Manipulations are subject to Hindering, but since there is no enemy in the same Area, this action is not Hindered. Batman thus achieves a total of 3 Successes, and opens the Safe. He finds a Submachine Gun inside, which Batman is able to carry since it has an Encumbrance value of 4, his Encumbrance limit is 6, and he is not carrying any other Equipment cards.

The controlling player performs the following steps: DECLARE A COMPLEX THOUGHT AND DETERMINE DIFFICULTY SPEND ENERGY CUBES (HEROES ONLY) AND CREATE THE DICE POOL ADD TOOL BONUSES (HEROES ONLY) ROLL THE DICE POOL REROLLS CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSES SUCCESSFUL ACTION UNSUCCESSFUL ACTION APPLY THE COMPLEX THOUGHT Declare a Complex Thought and Determine Difficulty They specify the single action being attempted with the Complex Thought. This may only be one of the following: - Perform a Complex Thought specified by one of the Skills possessed by the miniature. - Perform a Complex Thought specified by the Mission. Then, they determine the Difficulty of the action being attempted. The applicable value or calculation required is specified by the rules pertaining to the type of Complex Thought chosen. Spend Energy Cubes (Heroes only) and Create the Dice Pool HERO: The controlling player chooses 1 or more Energy cubes to spend, moving them from the Hero’s Reserve Zone to their Thought action space. The number of cubes spent may not cause the Hero to exceed their Thought Exertion limit. For each Energy cube spent, they take a die of the color indicated by the Hero’s Thought Characteristic on their Screen. Any dice taken collectively form the dice pool. For example, each Energy cube spent here (up to a maximum of 4 on this Thought action space) provides 1 Red die to the dice pool. NON-HERO: The controlling player takes the dice indi- cated by the Characteristic chosen for this action, forming the dice pool. For example, this Thought Characteristic provides 1 Orange and 1 Red die to the dice pool. Add Tool Bonuses (Heroes only) If the Hero is carrying any Tool cards (Bat-Gadget and/ or Equipment cards showing the Tool symbol ) which confer upon them bonuses applicable to the Complex Thought being attempted, the controlling player may apply these bonuses. They may apply bonuses from more than one different Tool card at the same time (although it is not allowed to combine the bonuses from identical Tool cards); the Hero will benefit from them for the rest of this action. For details of these bonuses, see page 22. Roll the Dice Pool The controlling player rolls the dice pool. Rerolls They may attempt to improve the roll by Rerolling (see page 50). Calculate the Number of Successes Count the number of Successes shown on all dice rolled (after any Rerolls, if applicable), and add any applicable Automatic Successes conferred by Skills the miniature possesses. Then, they subtract the Hindering Modifier (see next page) from the total. Compare the resulting number of Successes to the Difficulty level of the action, as follows: - If the result is equal to or higher than the action’s Difficulty level, the Complex Thought is successful, and they proceed to the next step. - If the result is lower than the action’s Difficulty level, the Complex Thought is unsuccessful. Unless otherwise specified, the action ends without applying further effects.

Apply the Complex Thought The controlling player carries out the chosen action, applying its effects. VII·E·2 [g] , * COMPLEX THOUGHT EXAMPLE For example, in ‘To Sink a City’, the special rules of the Mission indicate that a Villain miniature in the same Area as a Computer may Prime a Bomb remotely by performing a Complex Thought 1 . The Thugs with Crowbars are able to perform Thought actions (since their Character tile shows an appropriate Characteristic) 2 . The Villain player activates the Thug with Crowbar and performs a Complex Thought to use the Computer. According to the Mission special rules, this is of Difficulty 3. The Thug rolls 1 White and 1 Yellow dice, getting 1 Success 3 , but then Rerolls the White dice, getting 2 more Successes 4 .

DEFENSE Defending is not an action. When attacked by an enemy, the miniature being targeted automatically Defends. This may negate a number of the attacker’s Successes, reducing the number of Wounds suffered by the Defending miniature. Unless otherwise indicated, Defense is mandatory. NOTE: Defense is only triggered by Attacks. Other effects that can cause Wounds (such as those from Drops, Explosions, and Dangerous Terrain) cannot be Defended against.

The miniature being attacked is the Defender and its controlling player performs the following steps: SPEND ENERGY CUBES AND CREATE THE DICE POOL They choose a number of Energy cubes (including 0) to spend, moving them from the Defender’s Reserve Zone to their Defense space. The number of cubes spent may not cause the Defender to exceed their Defense space’s Exertion limit. Then, for each Energy cube spent, they take a die of the color indicated by the Defender’s Defense Characteristic (shown on the Hero’s Screen or the Defense Space tile on the Villain’s Command Post). Any dice taken collectively form the Defender’s dice pool. For example, each Energy cube spent here (up to a maximum of 5 on this Defense space) adds 1 Orange die to the Hero’s dice pool. For example, each Energy cube spent here (up to a maximum of 4) adds 1 Orange die to the Villain’s dice pool. ADD AUTOMATIC DEFENSE DICE (HEROES ONLY) If the Defending Hero has an Automatic Defense bonus, the controlling player takes a die of the color indicated by the bonus on the Hero’s Screen and adds it to their dice pool. For example, during Defense, 1 Orange die is added to this Hero’s dice pool. ROLL THE DICE POOL The controlling player rolls the Defender’s dice pool.

For example, the Defender has 2 Automatic Defense Successes 1 and rolls 2 Successes 2 . They have 4 total Defense Successes. NOTE: Defense is never affected by Hindering. DETERMINE AND APPLY WOUNDS Reduce the number of Successes attained by the attacking miniature (Attack Successes) by the number of Defense Successes, to a minimum of 0.

WOUNDS AND NEUTRALIZATION WOUNDS A miniature may suffer Wounds from the following: - Successful Attacks which target them. - Moving into or occupying an Area with Dangerous Terrain. - Other relevant effects, such as those from Explosions, Drops, Skills, or Mission special rules. When a Hero is Wounded, 1 Energy cube is moved from the Fatigue Zone on the Hero’s Bat-Tablet to the Wound Zone for each Wound suffered. If there are not enough cubes available in the Fatigue Zone, the remainder are moved from the Hero’s action, Defense, and/or Reroll spaces (in any combination of the controlling player’s choice), and finally, if all of these spaces are empty, from the Reserve Zone. When all of a Hero’s Energy cubes are in their Wound Zone, the Hero is Neutralized (see below), and any remaining Wounds that are yet to be applied are disregarded. For example, this Hero suffers 4 Wounds. First, the cube from the Fatigue Zone is moved to the Wound Zone 1 , then the 2 cubes are moved from their Reroll space 2 , and finally the last one is moved from their Reserve Zone 3 . When a Villain miniature with more than 1 Life Point is Wounded, the cube on the track in the Command Post above that Character’s Life Point marker is moved down 1 space for each Wound suffered. If the cube reaches 0 (the space with the Life Point marker), the miniature is Neutralized, and any remaining Wounds that are yet to be applied are disregarded. When a miniature corresponding to a non-Hero with only 1 Life Point is Wounded, they are Neutralized NEUTRALIZATION A Hero is Neutralized when all of their Energy cubes are in their Wound Zone. The Hero’s miniature remains in the Area of the Map they were occupying when they were Neutralized. While Neutralized, a Hero: - cannot perform any actions or Free Actions, Defenses, or Rerolls; - cannot be the target of an Attack; - cannot use any bonuses conferred by their Equipment cards, Bat-Gadgets, or Skills; and - does not count towards Hindering Modifiers. During the Declare Heroes’ Stances step of the Heroes’ turn, the Resting Stance must be chosen for any Neutralized Heroes as normal. As soon as any cubes are moved out of a Neutralized Hero’s Wound Zone during this step, they are no longer Neutralized, and the above restrictions no longer apply. A non-Hero miniature is Neutralized when they have 0 Life Points remaining. When a Villain miniature is Neutralized, it is removed from the Map and placed in the Character Pool. When all miniatures corresponding to a Character tile have been removed from the Map, the Character tile itself is Neutralized. When this happens, the Villain player remo- ves the tile from the River, slides the remaining tiles to the left to fill any gap, and places the Neutralized tile at the right end of the River, flipped so that its Neutralized side is facing up (indicating that there are now no cor- responding miniatures on the Map). For example, the last Brutes with Chains miniature has been Neutralized and placed in the Character Pool, so the Brutes with Chains Character tile is moved to the right end of the River, and flipped to its Neutralized side. The other tiles are slid to the left to close the gap. When a miniature controlled by a Character tile with a Hero’s Command Skill is Neutralized, it is removed from the Map. When all miniatures corresponding to a Character tile controlled with a Hero’s Command Skill have been removed from the Map, the Character tile is flipped to show its Neutralized side; it can no lon- ger be activated with the Command Skill. Miniatures removed from the Map in this way cannot be brought back into play unless permitted by the Mission’s spe- cial rules. In such a case, if a miniature being brought back into play corresponds to a Neutralized Character tile, the tile is flipped so it is no longer shown as Neutralized. IX A , IX B , 1 2 3 "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || REROLL 50 X. REROLL Rerolling is not an action. It allows a miniature to ignore the result of one or more dice that have been rolled, and roll them again, with the new results being taken into account instead. Unless otherwise indicated, players may always choose to Reroll after they have rolled dice for any reason. DECLARE REROLLING FREE REROLLS PAID REROLLS DECLARE REROLLING Having just rolled one or more dice, the player controlling the corresponding miniature decides to Reroll. This may be because they have reached the Rerolls step during an action or a Defense, or unless otherwise stated if they have rolled dice for any other reason (such as rolling for Wounds after a Drop or to apply the effects of Dangerous Terrain). They perform the following steps: FREE REROLLS If there were any Free Reroll symbols correspon- ding to the dice just rolled, the controlling player may use them now. Each symbol grants an optional Reroll of 1 die of the indicated color. They may choose to use as many Free Rerolls as they like and have available (including 0), rolling them together or individually as they like, until they run out of Free Rerolls or decide to stop. The results of these Rerolls now apply for the corresponding dice. It is not allowed to use more than 1 Free Reroll on the same die. NOTE: Where the Free Reroll symbol is shown on a Characteristic on a Hero action or Defense space, it indi- cates 1 Free Reroll of a single die of the color shown for each Energy cube spent on the corresponding space for this action or Defense. For example, Harley Quinn’s Manipulation action Characteristic 1 gives her 2 Orange dice of which up to 1 (of her choice) can be Rerolled for free 2 . For example, this Hero is performing a Melee Attack, and spends 2 Energy cubes on it 1 . Together with the Crowbar, this produces a dice pool of 3 Orange dice, which are then rolled. The 2 cubes spent for this action each provide 1 Free Reroll of an Orange die (the Crowbar and the cube that was on the action space from a previous action do not provide a Reroll). Therefore, up to 2 of the 3 Orange dice may be Rerolled for free 2 . PAID REROLLS The controlling player may pay Energy cubes to carry out additional Rerolls at the cost of one cube per die. If they wish to do so, they choose a number of Energy cubes to spend on these Rerolls, moving them from the corresponding miniature’s Reserve Zone to their Reroll space. The number of cubes they spend may not cause the miniature to exceed their Reroll space’s Exertion limit. Then, for each Energy cube spent, they choose 1 of the dice from the rolled dice pool to roll again. It is allowed to choose dice that have already been Rerolled as part of the Free Rerolls step above. The control- ling player rolls their chosen dice. The results of these Rerolls now apply for the corresponding dice. If they wish to (and have the available Energy cubes), they may continue attempting to improve the results by repeating this Paid Rerolls step, including Rerolling dice that have already been Rerolled during this step.

OTHER RULES LINE OF SIGHT Some actions and Skills require a Line of Sight to the target. There is Line of Sight between two Areas if at least one of the following conditions is met: - The two Areas are separated by an orange boun- dary line or a Broken Wall token. - An imaginary straight line can be drawn between Line of Sight markers in both Areas, without being blocked. - The two Areas each have a Line of Sight marker that shares at least 1 letter in common. XI A 1 , ORANGE BOUNDARY LINES AND BROKEN WALL TOKENS Any two Areas which share a boundary, at least part of which is an orange line or a Broken Wall token, automatically have Line of Sight to each other. For example, since there is an orange border between Batman’s and Killer Croc’s Areas, there is Line of Sight between them. XI A 2 , IMAGINARY STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN TWO LINE OF SIGHT MARKERS Two Areas have Line of Sight to each other if an imaginary straight line can be drawn between a Line of Sight marker in each Area and remain unblocked. A Line of Sight is unblocked if it does not cross any Walls (whether unbroken or covered by Broken Wall tokens), Obstructions, or an Area with a higher Elevation level than the two Areas. For example, when the Hero is in Area A , there is no Line of Sight between the miniatures because the straight line between the Line of Sight markers in their Areas crosses a Wall (as confirmed by the Map board reference sheet) 1 . If the Hero is in Area B , there is Line of Sight as the straight line drawn crosses only red boundaries, which allow Line of Sight. If an Area contains more than one Line of Sight marker, an unblocked line drawn from any one of them is suffi- cient. The Distance between the Areas does not matter. SPECIAL CASE: If the two Areas are of different Elevation levels, for Line of Sight to exist, the imaginary straight line cannot cross any Area with an Elevation level equal to or higher than the Elevation level of the higher of the two Areas. For example, there is no Line of Sight between Areas A and C for two reasons: the intermediate Area B , crossed by the line drawn between Line of Sight markers in Areas A and C , is an Obstruction; and Area B is also at the same Elevation level as Area A , which blocks Line of Sight because Area C is at a lower Elevation level than Area A . NOTE: Line of Sight markers can have dashed and solid rings of varying sizes. These indicate different levels of Elevation of their corresponding Areas and act as a reminder of that; however, the style of marker has no bearing on Line of Sight. Refer to the Map board refe- rence sheets for full details of a Map’s Elevation levels. XI A , OTHER RULES 1 "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || OTHER RULES C C C C B A C B B B B A A C B D 53 Obstructions are Areas that block Lines of Sight drawn through them regardless of Elevation levels of other Areas. They are marked on the Map board reference sheets. NOTE: While Line of Sight is blocked if the straight line crosses an Obstruction, it is not blocked if the straightline only starts and/or finishes on an Obstruction. For example, Area A has Line of Sight to all the Areas highlighted in green. Area A does not have Line of Sight to any of the Areas C because straight lines drawn from the Line of Sight marker in Area A to those in Areas C cross the Obstruction B (this represents the truck at B obscuring the view of the Areas behind it). NOTE: Area A is also an Obstruction, but it does not block Lines of Sight drawn from itself. XI A 3 , SHARING A COMMON LETTER Two Areas have Line of Sight to each other if Line of Sight markers in each Area have at least 1 letter in common. These letters are not a requirement for Line of Sight, but are some- times shown to make determining Line of Sight easier (for example, if two Areas are far apart, envisaging the straight line between their Line of Sight markers is harder). They can also denote the existence of Line of Sight when a straight line between Line of Sight mar- kers would normally be blocked. For example, there is a Line of Sight from Area A to all of the Areas B , even though there is an Obstruction at C because Area A shares at least one common letter with each of the Areas B . If it were not for these common letters, Line of Sight would be blocked by C . Additional notes: - If there is a Line of Sight between two Areas, all miniatures present in these Areas have Line of Sight to each other. - A miniature always has Line of Sight to its own Area. - Line of Sight is not blocked by miniatures. - If an Area does not have any Line of Sight markers, Line of Sight to that Area is only possible over a shared orange boundary or Broken Wall token. For example, Killer Croc’s Area has 2 Line of Sight markers. Straight lines can be drawn from both of these to the marker in Batman’s Area without being blocked (red and green lines). Therefore, Killer Croc has Line of Sight to Batman (although only one unblocked line would have been enough). There is also an unblocked line from one of the markers in Killer Croc’s Area to the one in Commissioner Gordon’s Area (yellow line). This line is not straightforward to imagine given the distance between the Areas and the proximity of the subway cars (which, as Walls, block Line of Sight lines that pass through them); however the presence of the same letter (F) on Line of Sight markers in both Killer Croc’s and Commissioner Gordon’s Areas confirms that the two Areas do have Line of Sight to each other. DANGEROUS TERRAIN X An Area that contains Dangerous Terrain represents dangers such as tanks of acid or rooms filled with toxic gas. When a miniature moves into an Area containing Dangerous Terrain, during the Apply the Effects of the Destination Area step, roll a number of Yellow dice equal to the total Dangerous Terrain level in the Area. The affected miniature may attempt to improve the roll by Rerolling. The miniature then suffers as many Wounds as the total number of Successes rolled. The total level of Dangerous Terrain in an Area is the sum of any and all of the following that are present in the Area: - The Dangerous Terrain icon X shown in the Area on the Map board. Its level is represented by X. - Each Flame ( ) or Gas ( ) token (either side up) adds 1 to the level of Dangerous Terrain in the Area. - Dangerous Terrain level may also be modified by Mission special rules. Increasing levels of Dangerous Terrain In addition to checking for Wounds when a minia- ture enters an Area of Dangerous Terrain, a similar check must also be made when an Area a miniature is occupying becomes Dangerous Terrain, or its level of Dangerous Terrain increases. In this case, follow the same rules as above, but roll a number of Yellow dice equal to the increase in level. For example, if Batman is in an Area that goes from not being Dangerous Terrain to level 2 Dangerous Terrain, 2 Yellow dice are rolled. XI B , "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || OTHER RULES 54 FIELD MODIFIER TOKENS There are 4 types of Field Modifier token: Flame, Gas, Frost, and Smoke Grenade. They are placed on the board through the use of Skills. They have an effect on the game for 2 rounds and are then removed. Each token has an “active” side and a “dissipating” side. When placed in an Area, place the token with the “active” side face up. During the Trigger the Start of the Turn Effects step of the side of the miniature that placed it, flip the token so that it has its “dissipating” side face up. If it was already showing the “dissipa- ting” side, remove it from the Area and place it in the general supply. The effect of a token is the same regardless of which of its sides is facing up. NOTE: A miniature is immune to the effects of Flame, Gas, or Frost tokens if, and only if, the corresponding Skill (Flame, Toxic Gas, or Frost, respectively) is on the minia- ture’s Screen or Character tile. For example, Mr. Freeze is always immune to all Frost tokens, as he has the Frost Skill on his Character tile. Batgirl, however, equipped with a Freezing Grenade is not immune to Frost tokens. The tokens and their effects are as follows: “ACTIVE” SIDE “DISSIPATING” SIDE EFFECT (SEE SKILLS & TRAITS BOOKLET) FLAME: Each token adds 1 level of Dangerous Terrain to an Area. Can be placed by miniatures possessing the Flame Skill. GAS: Each token adds 1 level of Dangerous Terrain to an Area. Can be placed by miniatures possessing the Toxic Gas Skill. FROST: Each token adds 1 level of Difficult Terrain to an Area. Can be placed by miniatures possessing the Frost Skill. SMOKE GRENADE: Each token negates 1 Success in Ranged Attacks from, to, or through an Area. Can be placed by miniatures possessing the Smoke Grenade Skill. During Ranged Attacks, at the end of the Calculate the Number of Successes step, the number of Successes obtained is reduced by the number of Smoke Grenade tokens in Areas along the Line of Sight (including the attacker’s Area and the target’s Area), to a minimum of zero Successes. EXPLOSIONS An Explosion is an effect that may be triggered by some Skills or Mission special rules. It is always asso- ciated with a level and an Area, as described in the rules for the corresponding Skill or Mission. When an Explosion occurs, any miniatures in the affected Area roll (and may Reroll) a number of Yellow dice equal to the level of the Explosion to determine how many Wounds (if any) they suffer. For example, Mr. Freeze throws a grenade into the Area containing Catwoman and a Thug 1 . The Skill level is 2, which indicates this is a level 2 Explosion 2 . Catwoman and the Thug each roll 2 Yellow dice to determine how many Wounds they suffer 3 . XI C , XI D , 1 2 3 "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || GLOSSARY 55 XII .

A Free Reroll allows a die of the indicated color to be Rerolled without spending a cube; however, only 1 Free Reroll may be used per die. Some Skills grant Bonus Rerolls, which also cost nothing but are not res- tricted to 1 per die. See the Luck, Point Blank, and Support Skills. RIVER The row of tiles along the bottom of the Command Post. See page 32 for rules on Dredging the River. SIZE INDEX A numeric value that represents the physical size of a miniature. It is used when determining Occupation limits and the Hindering Modifier during Movement. SUCCESS The number of Successes gained when performing some actions determines how effective that action is. Successes are typically gained from rolling dice (each symbol rolled counts as 1 Success), but can also be gained from Automatic Successes. Where applicable, Successes can be reduced or negated by Hindering, the effects of some Skills, or other effects (such as from Smoke Grenade tokens), but the total number of Successes gained can never be reduced below zero. An Automatic Success is a Success that is confer- red to a miniature by certain bonuses (such as those from a Skill or an Equipment card they possess), or a Mission’s special rules. Automatic Successes for Defense are called Automatic Defense Successes. When applicable, Automatic Successes are added to the obtained result during the Calculate the Number of Successes step of an action or Defense. WALL A Wall is a type of boundary between Areas, as indi- cated on the Map board reference sheets. Walls do not allow Movement through the boundaries they mark, and block any Lines of Sight that would be drawn through them. X A Wall may be associated with a level, as denoted by X on the reference sheets. Wall levels are relevant for the Wall Breaker Skill. Walls with no associated levels cannot be broken. WOUND See page 49 A miniature may suffer Wounds from an Attack, an Area with Dangerous Terrain, or other effects (Explosions, Drops, Skills, or Mission special rules). - When a Hero is Wounded, 1 Energy cube is moved to their Wound Zone for each Wound suffered. When all of a Hero’s Energy cubes are in their Wound Zone, the Hero is Neutralized. - When a non-Hero is Wounded, they lose 1 Life Point for each Wound suffered. When a non-Hero is reduced to 0 Life Points, they are Neutralized. "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || RULEBOOK 2.0 || CUSTOMIZING THE DIFFICULTY 58 CUSTOMIZING THE DIFFICULTY XIII . CUSTOMIZING THE DIFFICULTY To make the game easier or harder for the Heroes, use any or all of the following changes to the rules. VARIANT RULES THAT MAKE THE GAME EASIER FOR THE HEROES - During the Declare Heroes’ Stances step of the Heroes’ Turn, each Hero recovers 1 extra Energy cube, whichever Stance they choose. - A Resting Hero may perform the Movement action, but cannot spend Energy cubes on this action. I.e., they may only use Move Points gained from their First Movement Bonus. - Any Move Points granted from a Hero’s First Movement Bonus are not lost at the end of a Movement action. For example, a Hero with a First Movement Bonus of 2 may perform the Movement action and use 1 of those Move Points, leaving them with 1 remaining Move Point to use on a later Movement action in the same turn. NOTE: This variant affects the Tactician Skill. Any unused Move Points gained from the First Movement Bonus are not lost after the Tactician Skill is resolved, only unused Move Points from the Skill itself. - Once per game, each Hero may add 1 Success to any action they are performing. This happens during the Calculate the Number of Successes step. Place an unused component from the game near the Hero’s Bat-Tablet and remove it once this free Success is used. VARIANT RULES THAT MAKE THE GAME HARDER FOR THE HEROES - The Villain player spends 1 fewer Energy cube to activate the Event Warning tile. - The Villain player has one Free Reroll during the Heroes’ turn AND one Free Reroll during the Villain’s turn. - A Villain miniature’s First Movement Bonus may be split between the First Movement step and the Second Movement step. For example, a Brute with a First Movement Bonus of 2 may use 1 of those Move Points, then perform an action, then use the remai- ning 1 Move Point. XV A , XV B , ","",""]
