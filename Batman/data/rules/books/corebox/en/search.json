RULES PRIORITY HIERARCHY Batman: Gotham City Chronicles involves numerous effects due to cards, powers, abilities, etc. As such it is possible that two rules can appear to contradict each other. When this occurs, the following priority hierarchy is applied: 1 * MISSION SPECIAL RULES  2 * TRAITS  3 * SKILLS  4 * GAME RULES "," BATMAN : GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES || RULEBOOK || GAME COMPONENTS  5 II . GAME COMPONENTS MINIATURES X 166 There are three different colors: -blue for the heroes’ side; -gray for the villain’s side; -orange for the neutral side. Miniatures controlled with a tile are characters. Miniatures controlled with a hero board are heroes. The players who control them are also called heroes. The player controlling the villain’s side is called the villain. ENERGY CUBES X 46 The red cubes placed on the hero board and the villain Command Post represent the quantity of energy available to the players to manage their miniatures. DICE X 20 The dice are used to resolve all kinds of actions such as fights and bomb diffusals. Each symbol on them represents a success. There are 5 different dice types (4 of each color): white, yellow, orange, red, and black. GAME BOARDS X 2 Each game board is double-sided and rep-resents the game environment in which heroes and villains clash. They are divided into areas in which the miniatures operate. TURN TRACK X 1 AND TURN MARKER X 1 The turn marker is placed on the turn track which is numbered from 0 to 12 to keep track of the number of turns played in a mission. At the beginning of each mission, the marker is placed at 0. HERO BOARDS: SCREENS X 25 AND BAT-TABLETS X 3 Each hero uses a hero board to control their miniature. A hero board is made up of two parts: a screen and the Bat-tablet. When a player chooses their hero, they slide the corresponding screen into the Bat-tablet. Its use is described in the Hero Boards presentation paragraph ( see page 10 ). ITEM CARDS X 70 These cards represent the equipment and bat-gadgets the heroes can use during their missions. TILES X 65 These describe the profile of each con-trolled character. They belong to three different sides: -blue for the heroes; -gray for the villain; -orange for the neutral. There are three different types of tiles: -simple; -double; -event. LIFE POINT MARKERS X 37 Characters with more than one life point use a life point marker that is placed on the life point track on the command post. COMMAND POST X 1 The command post is the board used by the villain to control their troops. Its use is described in detail on page 28.

It has an elevation level and an occupation limit ( see expla-nation on page 43 ). Each area is delineated by area boundaries. NOTE: the decorative elements of an area are purely illustrative and have no effect on the location of a miniature ( FIG._1 ). AREA BOUNDARIES Area boundaries are defined in the game boards rules. There are four categories: -The white area boundary allows clear lines of sight ( see explanation on page 43 ) and allows sim-ple moves ( see explanation on page 21 ). -The orange area boundary allows clear lines of sight and allows simple moves. In addition, it indicates that the two areas separated share a clear line of sight. -The special area boundary is indicated in the game boards rules, but is not marked by a bound-ary line on the board. It allows clear lines of sight but prevents simple moves. -A wall is indicated in the game boards rules and is not marked by a line on the board. It blocks lines of sight and prevents simple moves. A wall may be associated with a level indicated in the game boards rules. ADJACENT AREAS Two areas are adjacent if they are separated by a white or orange area boundary ( FIG._2 ). AREA OCCUPATION LIMIT An area can only accommodate a limited number of miniatures. This is represented by its occupation limit: The total of the size indexes ( see explanation on page 43 ) of the miniatures present in an area can never exceed this limit ( FIG._3 ). LINE OF SIGHT MARKER Some areas have one or more line of sight mark-ers. These are used to determine if a miniature has a clear line of sight to another area. A line of sight marker can also include letters around it to facili-tate this process. ( see Determination of a clear line of sight on page 43 ) ( FIG._4 ). III A , III B , III C , III D , III E , III . GAME BOARDS Each mission indicates which game board to use. These boards have common characteristics as described below, in addition to special rules described in the game boards rules. X "," BATMAN : GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES || RULEBOOK || GAME BOARDS  ELEVATION LEVEL The level of elevation of each area is indicated in the game boards rules. PROMONTORY A promontory is a high area defined in the game boards rules. It blocks the lines of sight between two areas, regardless of their elevation level. However, these lines of sight can begin or end on a promontory without being blocked. A promontory is accessible only by a special move ( see explanation on page 21 ) which is defined in the game boards rules. DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TERRAIN Some areas are rugged and more diﬃ cult or dan-gerous for anyone to enter.

TRIGGER THE EFFECTS OF THE UPKEEP PHASE Some effects are plot-related and can range from a bomb exploding to an unexpected surge of rein-forcements. These are specified in the mission. -If the conditions for these effects are fulfilled, the effect is triggered as described in the mission. -If several effects happen at the same time, the side with initiative chooses the order in which they occur. TURN OF THE SIDE WITH INITIATIVE Each mission indicates which side has initiative: -If the heroes have initiative, they play according to the rules described in the Heroes’ Turn chap-ter. ( see page 11 ) -If the Villain has initiative, they play according to the rules described in the Villain’s Turn chapter. ( see page 30 ) IV A , IV A 1 , IV A 2 , IV B , IV . GAME TURN STRUCTURE The heroes’ side and the villain’s side take turns playing. The side with initiative is specified by the mission. The heroes’ side does not act according to a defined game turn (there is no notion of playing round-the-table), but instead they have the freedom to coordinate their actions. For example, a hero can carry out their chosen actions and then allow another hero to perform actions. This hero can then carry out any number of actions they wish before handing over to another hero, or the one that performed previously. The heroes’ turn continues in this way until the heroes decide unanimously to finish their turn, either because they no longer have any energy cubes available or because they wish to save them for a future turn. Once the heroes declare they are finished, it becomes the villain’s turn. The villain may play 0, 1, or 2 tiles in the river ( see explanation on page 28 ) to activate their characters or trigger events. Each character tile represents a miniature or a group of miniatures that the villain takes control of when activating it. The villain’s turn ends when they choose or when they cannot activate tiles anymore. The two sides alternate until an end-game condition of the mission is met.

Automatic thought , although a totally different action, works in exactly the same way as auto-matic manipulation. The player must follow the same sequence as for automatic manipulation, replacing the term “manipulation” with “thought” ( see page 19 ). HERO MOVEMENT The movement action consists of one or several moves made using move points. The move point pool corresponds to the number of move points the miniature can spend. Declare a Movement The hero declares a movement. Create the Move Point Pool The move point pool equals zero plus eventual bonuses conferred by skills, traits and special rules. Add Move Point Bonus for the First Movement If this movement action is the first of the hero’s turn for this miniature, they add their move point bonus to their move point pool. Choose Move Type The area in which the miniature is located is the start area. The hero chooses the area to which the miniature will move. This area is the destination area. A miniature cannot enter an area if by doing so they would over-occupy it ( see page 43 ). The des-tination area determines the type of move required: simple or special .

EQUIPMENT CARDS Hero encumbrance total The encumbrance total of a hero is the total of the encumbrance values of the equipment they are carrying. It cannot exceed the hero’s maximum encumbrance value. It determines their move point bonus. A hero can benefit from a skill only while their encumbrance total is lower than the encumbrance limit of the skill. Picking up equipment Picking up equipment is an automatic manipulation. A hero can only pick up equipment if it is located in their area and their maximum encumbrance value is not exceeded when the equipment is picked up. During the Apply the Automatic Manipulation step ( see page 19 ), the hero places the picked-up equip-ment next to their hero board. Giving equipment Giving equipment is an automatic manipulation. During the Spend Energy Cube step of an automatic manipulation, only the hero who gives the equip-ment spends an energy cube. To give equipment, the following criteria are necessary: -The receiving hero accepts the equipment. -Both heroes are in the same area. -The equipment would not cause the maximum encumbrance value of the hero receiving it to be exceeded. During the Apply the Automatic Manipulation step ( see page 19 ), the hero receiving the equipment places it next to their hero board. Taking equipment Taking equipment is an automatic manipulation.

"," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES || RULEBOOK || THE HEROES  26 26 Throwing equipment Throwing equipment is a complex manipulation. To perform this action, a hero must have a clear line of sight to the target area. During the Declare a Complex Manipulation step, the diﬃ culty level of the throw must be calculated. This is equal to the distance ( see page 43 ) from the hero’s area to the target area. During the Calculate the Number of Successes step, the encumbrance value of the thrown equipment as well as any possible hindering index is subtracted from the number of successes obtained. During the Apply the Complex Manipulation step, the number of successes is compared to the diﬃ -culty level of the throw: -If the number of successes is equal to or higher than the diﬃ culty level of the throw, the hero places the equipment in the target area. -If the number of successes is lower than the diﬃ culty level of the throw, the hero places the equipment at a distance that is equal to the obtained number of successes, along the line of sight towards the target area. Dropping equipment Dropping equipment is not an action and does not require any energy cubes to be spent. A hero can drop equipment at any time. The card is then placed in their area. BAT-GADGET CARDS During the set-up of a mission, the heroes with a utility belt can choose their bat-gadgets from all the bat-gadgets available in the game.

FIG._61 · The villain ﬂips the bomb token and decides not to move in order to protect this objective, ending the activation of this Thug with crowbar. REINFORCEMENT As soon as reinforcement points have been gained by the villain, they must be spent. Miniatures with a reinforcement cost on their tile can be returned to the game as a reinforcement. To do this, the villain must spend the indicated reinforcement points. The miniature is then taken from the character pool and placed in any of the reinforcement areas indicated in the mission by this token: A reinforced character must not over-occupy the area they are placed in. If a character must come into play in an area that it would over-occupy, it is placed in an adjacent area that it does not over-occupy. If the adjacent areas are all over-occupied, the character does not come into play. Unspent reinforcement points are lost. When a miniature of a neutralized tile (a facedown tile) ( see page 42 ) is brought back into play, the vil-lain ﬂips the tile face up. -Character pool The character pool represents the miniatures that the villain can use as reinforcements. Unless otherwise indicated, the pool of characters of a tile is zero. However, a mission may spec-ify that miniatures should be placed in this pool during setup. DREDGING THE RIVER Dredging the river is not an action and does not count as activating a tile. At any moment during their turn, the villain can dredge the river by removing one or several neu-tralized tiles ( see page 42 ) and placing them back in the game box. This costs two energy cubes per tile. These cubes are removed from the game and must be taken from the villain’s fatigue zone. If there are not enough cubes in this zone, the villain can remove cubes from their spaces, then from their reserve zone. There is no limit to the number of neutralized tiles that can be removed from the river as long as the villain has enough energy cubes to do so. The miniatures of a tile thus removed cannot be brought back into play, even during reinforcement. DEMOBILIZATION The demobilization is not an action and does not count as activating a tile. Once per game, during their turn, the villain can demobilize an elite or henchman character tile. In other words, dredge the river of this tile as though it was neutralized and remove all the miniatures under its control from the board.

SPEND ENERGY CUBES The defender choses the number of energy cubes they will move from their reserve zone to their defense space, with a minimum of zero. This corre-sponds to their defense intensity. The defender cannot spend energy cubes on the defense space if doing so would exceed its exertion limit. If the exertion limit has already been reached, the defender moves directly to the Add the Automatic Defense Die step. CREATE THE DICE POOL The defender creates their dice pool, they take as many dice indicated by their defense characteristic as the number of energy cubes just spent. ADD THE AUTOMATIC DEFENSE DICE The defender adds the potential automatic defense die to their dice pool. ROLL THE DICE POOL The defender rolls their dice pool. REROLLS The defender can attempt to improve the roll result by rerolling ( see page 41 ). CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSES The defender adds together the number of suc-cesses.

FREE REROLLS This icon shows the player that they have a free reroll of the specified die type (in this example, a free reroll of an orange die). When you roll your dice pool, you may reroll one die of this color for every reroll icon (of the same color) you have. A die can be rerolled for free only once. The player can use the free rerolls available to him. They then roll the dice of the free reroll. DECLARE ANY PAID REROLLS The player can then pay to carry out additional rerolls. They declare if they will pay to reroll the dice. First, choose one or more of the dice from the rolled dice pool. These dice can come from the free rerolls carried out in the previous step. If the player does not want to reroll, they move directly to the End the Rerolls step. SPEND ENERGY CUBES The player moves as many energy cubes as the num-ber of dice they wish to reroll to the reroll space. The player cannot spend energy cubes on the reroll space if doing so would exceed its exertion limit. If the exertion limit has already been reached, the reroll ends. ROLL THE CHOSEN DICE The player rolls their chosen dice. They then decide if they will continue to carry out rerolls. If yes, they return to the Declare the Paid Rerolls step. If not, they move to the next step. END THE REROLLS Rerolls end. VIII A , VIII B , VIII C , VIII D , VIII E , VIII F , VIII . REROLL Rerolling is not an action.

These cubes are first taken from their fatigue zone, then from their spaces, and finally from their reserve zone. A hero is neutralized when all their energy cubes are in their wound zone. When a character with several life points is wounded , the cube used as the life point marker is moved down the same number of spaces in the command post as wounds suffered. If the cube reaches 0, the character is neutralized. When a character with only one life point is wounded , they are neutralized. NEUTRALIZED A neutralized hero can no longer perform actions. They must choose a resting stance and their skills are no longer taken into account for this turn. When a character is neutralized, their miniature is removed from the board and placed in the charac-ter pool. When all the characters of a tile have been removed from the board, the tile is neutralized. When a tile is neutralized, the villain removes it, slides the remaining tiles to the left and then replaces it neu-tralized side face up at the end of the river on the right. SPENDING ENERGY This is the term used to describe the transfer of a num-ber of cubes from the reserve zone to an action space, the reroll space, the defense space or the fatigue zone. DICE TYPES A dice type is characterized by its color and the presence or absence of a free reroll icon. CHARACTERISTICS A characteristic defines the ability of a miniature to perform an action or defend itself. It can be pre-sented in different ways: 1 , · One or several dice of one or several types 1.1 · A multiplier of action 2 , · A multiplier of move points 3 , · No dice are added during the Create the Dice Pool step. However, the miniature can benefit from bonuses (weapon bonus, skill, etc.). 4 , · The miniature cannot perform the action or defend itself. IX A , IX B , IX C , IX D , IX E , IX . GENERAL CONCEPTS "," BATMAN : GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES || RULEBOOK || GENERAL CONCEPTS  FIG._65 , FIG._66 , FIG._67 , FIG._68 , 43 AUTOMATIC SUCCESS An automatic success is a success that is always added to the obtained result during the Calculate the Number of Successes step. FREE ACTION The actions that are gained during the use of a skill, or with a special rule in a mission, are called free actions. AREA OVER-OCCUPATION When a player wants to check if an area is over-oc-cupied for a miniature, the size indexes of the miniatures already in this area must be added together plus the size index of the miniature in question. If this total is greater than the area’s occupation limit, it is said that the miniature “over-occupies” it. If a miniature must come into play in an area that it over-occupies, it is placed in an adjacent area that it does not over-occupy. If the adjacent areas are all over-occupied, the miniature does not come into play. EXERTION LIMIT When a player moves an energy cube to a space, they must first check that the exertion limit has not been reached. A space is considered saturated if it contains the same number of energy cubes as its exertion index. If it is saturated, the player cannot spend cubes on it. DISTANCE The distance between two areas is measured by counting the minimum number of moves that sepa-rates them (not the move cost). NEGATIVE VALUE There is never a negative value in BATMAN™: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES . Therefore, there cannot be a nega-tive hindering index, number of successes, etc. Any result that would be negative is considered equal to zero. DETERMINATION OF A LINE OF SIGHT Some actions and skills require having a clear line of sight to the target, as indicated in their description. There is a clear line of sight between two areas if at least one of the following conditions is met: -An imaginary straight line is drawn between their respective line of sight markers, inde-pendently of distance, without this line crossing walls, promontories or an area with an elevation higher than the two areas. However, this line can start or finish on a promontory ( see page 7 ) -They are adjacent and separated by the orange area boundary. -They have at least one letter in common around their respective line of sight markers. As soon as there is a clear line of sight between two areas, the miniatures present in these areas have a clear line of sight to each other. IX F , IX G , IX H , IX I , IX J , IX K , IX L , "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES || RULEBOOK || GENERAL CONCEPTS  --= = FIG._69 , 44 When a line of sight must be determined between two areas of different elevation levels, an additional condition must be fulfilled: the line of sight must not cross an area with an elevation level equal to the higher elevation level of the two areas. A miniature always has a clear line of sight to its own area. Lines of sight are not blocked by miniatures. ENEMY AND ALLY MINIATURES Enemy: a character or hero that belongs to the oppo-site side of a miniature. Ally: a character or hero that belongs to the same side of a miniature. The one is not taken into account when counting the number of ally miniatures. HINDERING When a miniature performs certain actions in an area that contains enemy miniatures, the actions can be affected by hindering. Hindering is represented by a hindering index that is calculated differently according to the action being performed: -If a miniature performs a move, the hindering index is calculated based on the size indexes of the other miniatures present in the area the miniature is leaving: HINDERING INDEX (MINIMUM 0) Total size index of allied miniatures Total size index of allied miniatures -If a miniature performs a ranged attack, a com-plex manipulation or a complex thought, the hindering index is calculated based on the men-ace indexes of the other miniatures present in the action area: HINDERING INDEX (MINIMUM 0) Total menace index of the enemy miniatures Total menace index of allied miniatures IMPORTANT: the miniature performing the action is not included in the calculation. DISSIPATION The dissipation tokens have temporary effects then dissipate. Their effects are described in the skills description or in the mission. Triangle shaped, these tokens have two different sides: Gas Token Flame Token Smoke Grenade Token Frost Token AN ICON “ACTIVE” FACE UP AN ICON “DISSIPATING” FACE UP During the Trigger the Start of the Turn Effects step of the side of the player who placed it: -If the token is “active” face up, it is turned face down with the “dissipating” side visible. -If the token is “dissipating” face up, it is removed. DIFFICULT TERRAIN Diﬃ cult terrain are areas ill-suited for movement (ice, roof, etc.). They are indicated by this icon on the game board: IX M , IX N , IX O , IX P , X "," BATMAN : GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES || RULEBOOK || GENERAL CONCEPTS  45 Diﬃ cult terrain is always associated with a level. The total level of diﬃ cult terrain is calculated, at all times, by adding together the different levels of diﬃ cult terrain present in the area. Some skills or special rules add levels of diﬃ culty to terrain by using tokens. If a miniature wants to leave a diﬃ cult terrain area, the total level must be added to the move cost. DANGEROUS TERRAIN Dangerous terrain are areas that can wound the miniatures that enter (tanks of acid, rooms filled with toxic gas, etc.). This icon represents dangerous terrain. It always indicates the associated level. The total level of dangerous terrain is calculated, at all times, by adding together the different levels of dangerous terrain present in the area. Some skills or special rules add levels of danger to terrain by using tokens. -If a miniature wants to enter dangerous terrain, during the Apply the Effects of the Destination Area step, they roll the same number of yellow dice as the total level of dangerous terrain of the area. They then suffer a number of wounds equal to the successes obtained. -If terrain becomes dangerous, a miniature present in the area must immediately roll the same num-ber of yellow dice as the total level of dangerous terrain of the area. They then suffer a number of wounds equal to the successes obtained. -If the total level of the dangerous terrain increases, a miniature present in the area must immediately roll the same number of yellow dice as the increase in level. They then suffer a num-ber of wounds equal to the successes obtained. EXPLOSION An explosion is an effect. It is always associated with a level and a target area determined by a skill or a special rule. During an explosion, the player who triggers it per-forms the following steps: TEMPORARILY INCREASE THE DANGEROUS TERRAIN LEVEL OF THE TARGETED AREA -If the targeted area is not dangerous terrain, it becomes one whose level is equal to that of the explosion. -If the targeted area is dangerous terrain, its level is increased by the level of the explosion. RETURN TO THE INITIAL STATE OF THE TARGETED AREA After having applied the wounds linked to the tem-porary increase of the total level of the dangerous terrain, the total level of dangerous terrain reverts to its initial value.
