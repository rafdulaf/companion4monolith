"," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 6 TERMINOLOGY The Solo / Co-op game uses some terminology in addition to that of the multiplayer game. LEADER: A miniature with its own Leader Activation card for the Mission. HERO: All uses of the term Hero in this rule- book also refer to any non-Hero miniature controlled by the Hero players (i.e., a valid tar- get for the Villain miniatures). Exception: The Batmobile is not classed as a Hero. MINION: All non-Leader Villain miniatures. CLOSEST: Some rules refer to the “closest” Hero / Area / Objective / etc. Closest is defined as the fewest Move Points required to move to the target. GOLDEN RULE If you are ever required to make a decision on behalf of the AI and it is not covered by the rules or on the Mission sheet, choose the option which is the best for the Villain, select- ing randomly if all options are equally good for the Villain. MISSION STRUCTURE The overall structure of the Solo / Co-op game remains the same as a normal game with sides taking it in turns within a round. The changes to the rules are as follows: A HEROES’ TURN Similar to the multiplayer game, the AI is lim- ited to what it can do during the Heroes’ turn: DEFENSE MISFORTUNE SKILL COUNTERATTACK SKILL RETALIATION SKILL DEFENSE For Minions, the AI will spend 1 Energy cube in Defense if the number of Attack Successes is exactly 1 more than the Automatic Defense of the Minion (i.e., if rolling 1 Defense Success would prevent the miniature from suffering Wounds). For Leaders, the AI will spend 1 Energy cube if the number of Attack Successes is greater than the Automatic Defense of the Leader. III . IV . V . ","2  BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 7 For example, Batman performs a Melee Attack on the Brute with Firearm (which has 2 Automatic Defense). If Batman gains 3 Attack Successes, the AI will try to Defend. If Batman gained 4 or more Attack Successes, the AI will not try to Defend. MISFORTUNE The AI will use the Misfortune Skill at every opportunity. If Successes are good for the Heroes, it will always force a Reroll of the die with the most Successes, while if Successes are bad for the Heroes it will force Rerolls of blanks only. If tied, it will choose a die in the following order:     For example, Batman is performing a Melee Attack on a Brute with Chains in the same Area as Scarecrow (who has level 2 Misfortune). Batman rolls 2 Orange dice and 1 Yellow die for the Attack and gets the results shown. The AI uses his first Misfortune Reroll on the Orange die with 2 Successes. It is Rerolled, but rolls 2 Successes again. The AI uses his sec- ond Misfortune Reroll on the same die again (Misfortune Rerolls can Reroll the same die more than once). If the first Reroll of the Orange die resulted in a blank, the AI would have used its sec- ond Reroll on the Yellow die. COUNTERATTACK / RETALIATION The AI will use these Skills at every opportu- nity following the normal rules. B VILLAIN’S TURN The Villain’s turn follows the same 4 steps as the multiplayer game. MOVE SPENT ENERGY CUBES TRIGGER THE START OF THE VILLAIN’S TURN EFFECTS ACTIVATE 0, 1, OR 2 TILES TRIGGER THE END OF THE VILLAIN’S TURN EFFECTS Steps 1, 2, and 4 are unaffected. In Step 3, reveal the top card of the AI deck and resolve its effects. This card determines which tiles the AI activates. If the revealed card is a Tile Activation card, resolve it as described below. If it is a Leader Activation card, follow the rules on page 14. After doing so, place the card face up on the discard pile next to the deck (unless instructed otherwise). RESOLVING A TILE ACTIVATION CARD The Tile Activation card indi- cates the two tiles that the AI will try to activate. First, check the icon at the top of the left column. It indicates either a position in the River (1, 2, 3, or 4), or the Leader icon. If the icon is a position in the River, the AI spends Energy cubes corre- sponding to that position and then resolves that column. If the AI does not have enough Energy cubes to activate the tile, skip to the second column. - If the tile it would activate is Neutralized, move that tile to the end of the River (at no cost). Then, activate the tile that now occu- pies the position indicated by the card. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 8 If the icon is the Leader icon, the AI acti- vates the non-neutralized Leader tile in the lowest position of the River at no cost in Energy cubes. NOTES: The AI only gets to activate the Leader tile for free if the column depicts the Leader icon; if the Leader tile was activated because it was in the position indicated by the icon, the AI would pay to activate the tile as normal. - If there are no Leader tiles in the River, or if all Leader tiles in the River are Neutralized, ignore this activation. After resolving the left column, resolve the right column in a similar way, skipping the activation if the icon depicts a position in the River and the AI does not have enough Energy cubes to activate the tile. NOTE: It is possible, though unlikely, that the AI could skip both tile activations. Once it has been determined which tile is acti- vated, move it to the end of the River as normal. If the activated tile was the Event Warning tile, refer to the rules on page 18. Otherwise, activate each miniature shown on the activated tile, starting from the top left Area on the Map and going in “Reading Order” (left to right, top to bottom). If two or more miniatures currently being activated are in the same Area, you choose the order in which they are activated. When a miniature is activated, use the Task icons in the column of the AI card to determine which Task the miniature performs. The minia- ture will perform at most 1 Task, and will only perform a Task if it is able to complete it. To identify which Task it will perform, first assess whether the miniature is able to complete the top Task in the column; if it is able to, carry out that Task in full, and once it has completed it, the miniature’s activation is over. If it cannot com- plete it, ignore that Task and assess whether the miniature is able to complete the next Task in the column instead, and so on, continuing in the same way down the column until the miniature has either completed 1 Task or it has been deter- mined that the miniature is unable to complete any of the Tasks in the column. The Tasks shown on Tile Activation cards are as follows: ATTACK (see page 9) ADVANCE (see page 10) PROTECT (see pages 11-12) Each Task details the conditions under which it is completed. Refer to the “Completed Task” sections of each Task’s rules for details. If it is unable to complete any of the Tasks in the col- umn, the miniature will instead Move towards the closest Hero (see Move Towards Hero on page 13). Once it has completed 1 Task (or moved towards the closest Hero), the miniature’s acti- vation is over. For example, the Tile activation card has “1” in the left column indicating that the first tile in the River should be activated; the Brutes with Chains are in the first position in the River and are therefore activated first. When each Brute is activated, they first try to Attack, then they try to Advance, and finally they try to Protect. If they cannot complete any of those Tasks, they move towards the nearest Hero instead. "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 9 · ATTACK The miniature currently being activated attempts to Attack a Hero. If the miniature is able to perform both Melee Attacks and Ranged Attacks, refer to the Attack type icon on the bottom of the Tile Activation card to determine which Attack it will try to use first. If it cannot perform that type of Attack, it will choose the other. For example, the Character tile shown above has both a Melee Attack and a Ranged Attack. The bottom of the current Tile Activation card indicates they will use their Melee Attack for this activation if able. In the event that they could not use their Melee Attack they would use their Ranged Attack instead. First, check to see if the miniature is able to per- form an Attack without having to move first. A miniature will not move before attacking if it: - is already in the same Area as a Hero; or - is in reach of a Hero and has the Reach Skill; or - has Line of Sight to a Hero and is performing a Ranged Attack. NOTE: A miniature in the same Area as a Hero will not move out of the Area, even if performing a Ranged Attack with a Hindering Modifier. If the miniature is unable to perform an Attack without moving, do the following: MELEE ATTACK: The miniature will move towards the closest Hero and per- form a Melee Attack (using Reach if able), spending a maximum of 1 Energy cube for additional movement if required. See page 13 for the full rules on AI movement. RANGED ATTACK: The miniature will move the shortest Distance possible to reach an Area where it has Line of Sight to one or more Heroes. If more than one valid Area is the same Distance from the miniature’s cur- rent position, the moving miniature favors an Area where it will benefit from an Elevation bonus if possible. If there is more than one valid Area with elevation, choose at random. If the miniature has a choice of which Hero to attack, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules on page 13. USING SKILLS WHEN ATTACKING The AI will attempt to use all relevant Skills when attacking including Berserk, Burst, Circular Strike, Combo, Electricity, Immobilization, Martial Arts, Marksman, Point Blank, Poison, and Sneak Attack. When determining targets for the Burst and Combo Skills, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules on page 13. The Frost, Flame, and Toxic Gas Skills are applied only if the Heroes would be affected at the time the Skill is used, even if there are Villain miniatures that would also be affected. MINIATURES WITH MULTIPLE ATTACKS If the attacking miniature has multiple Attack options, refer to the number in the hexagon below the Attack type icon on the bottom of the Tile Activation card. For example, the Character tile shown above has two options for a Melee Attack. The bottom of the current Tile Activation card indicates they will use the first one (which provides 1 Yellow die and 1 Black die to the dice pool, each with 1 Free Reroll). COMPLETED TASK The Attack Task is only completed if the acti- vating miniature was able to perform an Attack. VI . "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 10 · ADVANCE The activating miniature moves towards the closest Villain Objective that the miniature is able to try and advance and attempts to advance it, spending a maximum of 1 Energy cube for additional movement if required. See page 13 for the full rules on AI movement. The Villain Objectives for each Mission are listed on the Mission sheet. If there are two or more Villain Objectives clos- est to the activating miniature, select the one with the fewest Heroes in the same Area as the Villain Objective. If still tied, break any remain- ing ties randomly. COMPLETED TASK The Advance Task is only completed if the activating miniature was able to attempt to advance a Villain Objective. The Advance Task is not completed if any of the following are true: - There is no Villain Objective at the start of the miniature’s activation. - The activating miniature cannot reach a Villain Objective. - The activating miniature is unable to advance the Objective because they do not possess the correct Characteristic. For example, in the Icy Welcome Mission, the Villain Objectives are to set up the Cryogenic Devices which requires a Complex Thought Action. If all of the Computer miniatures have been removed from the Map, or the activating miniature cannot reach one of them, or the activating min- iature cannot perform Complex Thought Actions, the Task is not completed. VII . "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 11 · PROTECT The activating miniature tries to protect one of the active Hero Objectives, making it harder for the Heroes to complete their Mission. The Hero Objectives for each Mission are listed on the Mission sheet. A Hero Objective starts as active and becomes inactive if the Heroes can no longer interact with that Objective in order to win the Mission. An inactive Hero Objective is ignored for the purposes of the Protect Task. For example, in the Good Cops / Bad Cops Mission, the Heroes need to retrieve one of the Briefcases. Once they have done this, the other Briefcase becomes an inactive Objective. First, determine whether the activating minia- ture moves: MINIATURE DOES NOT MOVE If the miniature is already located in the same Area as, or an Adjacent Area to an active Hero Objective, do not move the miniature. Exception: If the miniature cannot perform an Attack from its current position, but, by mov- ing, the miniature can move to an Area with, or an Area Adjacent to, an active Hero Objective, and then perform an Attack on a Hero minia- ture, it does so. For example, the Thug with Firearm is currently in an Area with an unprimed Bomb (an active Hero Objective) but is unable to Attack from its current position. However, the Thug could move 3 Areas to an Area Adjacent to another active Hero Objective (the unprimed Bomb in the subway car) and then Attack Batman, so it does. MINIATURE DOES MOVE If the miniature is not in the same Area as, or an Adjacent area to an active Hero Objective, follow the options below until a valid option is reached and then resolve that option. The miniature moves to: - An Area containing an active Hero Objective where there are 1 or more Heroes in that Area. - An Area Adjacent to an active Hero Objective where there are 1 or more Heroes in that Area. - An Area containing an active Hero Objective. - An Area Adjacent to the closest active Hero Objective. See page 13 for the full rules on AI movement , remembering that the activating miniature will spend a maximum of 1 Energy cube when moving, if required. If there are two or more active Hero Objectives that the miniature can reach (or get Adjacent to), select the one with the fewest Villain min- iatures in the same Area as the active Hero Objective. If still tied, select the closest one. If still tied, break any remaining ties randomly. VIII . ","2 1 A B C  BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 12 For example, a member of the Riddler’s Gang is resolving the Protect Task. He has a First Movement Bonus of 2 and the Parkour 1 Skill. The Minion moves to the Area containing Batman, spending 1 Energy cube for a total of 3 Move Points (Option A , an Area containing an active Hero Objective containing 1 or more Heroes). If Batman was not there, the Minion would move to the Area with Nightwing, again, spending 1 Energy cube (Option B , an Area Adjacent to an active Hero Objective containing 1 or more Heroes). If neither Batman nor Nightwing were there, the Minion will choose Option C , an Area containing an active Hero Objective. There are two active Hero Objectives it can reach by using 3 Move Points, but it moves onto the truck as it is the one with the fewest Villain miniatures in its Area. If there were no Villain miniatures in either of the two Areas it could reach, it would choose the closest one. MINIATURE ATTACKS IF ABLE Whether the miniature moves or not, it then performs an Attack if able. - For a Melee Attack, they target a Hero in their Area. - For a Ranged Attack, they target the closest Hero they have Line of Sight to. If the miniature did not perform an Attack, and is now in the same Area as a Villain Objective that they are able to advance, they attempt to do so. For example, in the Mission “To Sink a City”, Bomb tokens are both Hero and Villain Objectives. Therefore if a Thug with Crowbar is resolving a Protect Task, but there is no Hero in or Adjacent to an Area with a Bomb token, the Thug moves to a Bomb token and then, because it is also a Villain Objective and they have not performed an Attack, the Thug then attempts to advance it. COMPLETED TASK The Protect Task is only completed if the acti- vating miniature ends its activation in an Area containing an active Hero Objective, or an Area Adjacent to a active Hero Objective. The Protect Task is not completed if any of the following are true: - There are no active Hero Objectives. - The activating miniature cannot reach an active Hero Objective, or an Area adjacent to an active Hero Objective. "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 13 OTHER RULES MOVE TOWARDS HERO If the miniature is unable to complete any of the Tasks on the AI card, they move towards the closest Hero, getting as close as they can. If two or more Heroes are the closest, break ties as per the rules on Hero Tiebreaker below. Unlike most other movement, the AI will not spend an Energy cube in this situation, even if doing so would bring them closer to their target. HERO TIEBREAKER In any situation where the AI has a choice of which Hero to target, use the text at the top of the current AI card to decide which Hero to target. If more than one Hero meets this condi- tion, choose between those Heroes randomly. AI MOVEMENT The AI may perform movement with a minia- ture during resolution of any of the Tasks. The rules for AI movement are the same no matter which Task is being resolved. When moving, a miniature always takes the shortest valid route to its target Area. This is defined by the fewest Move Points required to reach that Area. Additional Move Point costs such as Difficult Terrain, Climb / Jump levels and Hindering Modifiers apply as usual. The miniature’s Skills and Traits also apply as usual, such as Mobility, Parkour, Elusive and Fly. A miniature will use their Wall Breaker Skill if using it makes the new route shorter. When moving, if a miniature could reach its target or gain Line of Sight by spending 1 Energy cube, the AI does so (provided they do not exceed their Movement Exertion limit). A miniature will never spend more than 1 Energy cube on a single movement. AI miniatures never enter an Area with Dangerous Terrain unless they are immune to its effects. AI miniatures never perform a Drop as part of their movement. DREDGING THE RIVER & DEMOBILIZATION The AI does not Dredge the River or Demobilize a tile unless the Mission sheet specifically states otherwise. IX . "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 14 RESOLVING A LEADER ACTIVATION CARD If the AI card drawn is a Leader Activation card, the AI activates the Leader whose name appears at the top of the card. Move the corre- sponding tile in the lowest numbered position of the River to the end. This activation does not cost the AI any Energy cubes. The Leader then resolves two Tasks. Roll a d6 and resolve the Task corresponding to the number rolled on the Leader Activation card. If the Leader cannot complete the Task depicted (the details for each Task list the cir- cumstances in which the Task is ignored), pro- ceed to the next numbered Task on the card (looping from 6 to 1 if needed). Continue this process until one of the Tasks is completed. Once the Leader has completed their first Task, resolve the next numbered Task on the card after the one just completed (looping from 6 to 1 if needed). If the Leader cannot complete the Task depicted, proceed to the next numbered Task on the card (looping if needed). Continue this process until a second Task is completed. X If the Task icon has a number depicted below it, the relevance of that number is described in the details of that Task below. Tasks for Leaders may “break” the normal rules of the game. Ensure that they are carried out as described below. This may mean that a Villain moves more than they are normally allowed to, performs more actions than they normally can, etc. If the Leader has been Neutralized, resolve the Restore Task as the Leader’s first Task. Then, roll d6 to determine the second Task. For example, the Joker is activated, and the d6 roll is a 3, indicating the Leader tries to resolve the Manipulate / Thought Task. Since there are no Villain Objectives on the Map that can be advanced using a Complex Manipulation / Thought, this Task is ignored, so the Ranged Attack Task (number 4) is resolved instead. Assuming the Joker is able to resolve that, the next Task they try to resolve is Task 5: Hit & Run. X . ","1 · 3 4· 6  BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 15 LEADER TASKS When resolving Tasks on a Leader Activation card, the AI may use as many additional Energy cubes as required to reach their target Area (up to the normal limit on the Command Post). Miniatures cannot be moved into or through Areas with Dangerous Terrain, or if movement would cause the Area to be Over-Occupied. If this would happen, select the next closest legal target instead. If the Leader is unable to reach the target Area of the Task it is attempting, ignore this Task and attempt to resolve the next Task in numeric order. If the AI is unable to resolve any of the Tasks shown on the card, it performs Move Towards Hero as its first Task (see page 13). For its second Task, the Leader attempts to perform the Task rolled on the d6. If the Leader is unable to reach the target Area to perform its second Task, it performs Move Towards Hero instead. ATTACK: MELEE Move the Leader to the Area of the closest Hero. If two or more Heroes are the closest, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. Then, the Leader per- forms a Melee Attack on the Hero. If the Leader has two Melee Attack options, roll a d6 and add the number of Heroes in the Leader’s Area. If the result is 5 or less, use the first option. If the result is 6 or more, use the second option. ATTACK: MELEE / RANGED Roll a d6: - 1-3 Resolve the Melee Task (see above). - 4-6 Resolve the Ranged Task (see below). ATTACK: POINT BLANK Move the Leader to the Area of the closest Hero. If two or more Heroes are the closest, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. Then, the Leader performs a Ranged Attack on the Hero using their Point Blank Skill to reroll a dice that has 0 Successes. If the Leader has two Ranged Attack options, roll a d6 and add the number of Heroes in the Leader’s Area. If the result is 5 or less, use the first option. If the result is 6 or more, use the second option. ATTACK: RANGED Move the Leader to an area that has Line of Sight of the Hero that is the closest to the Villain’s current area. If two or more Heroes are the clos- est, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules to determine which one is the target. If there are multiple Areas that the Leader has Line of Sight from, choose one with Elevation bonus if possible. If still tied, choose at random. Then, perform a Ranged Attack on the Hero. If the Leader has two Ranged Attack options, roll a d6 and add the number of Heroes that the Leader has Line of Sight to. If the result is 5 or less, use the first option. If the result is 6 or more, use the second option. ATTACK: REACH MELEE Move the Leader to an Area at a distance of X to the closest Hero from which the Villain can per- form a Melee Attack with the Reach Skill. If two or more Heroes are the closest, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. If multiple Areas are available, choose the one containing the most Villain miniatures. If still tied, choose at random. Then, the Leader performs a Melee Attack on the Hero, using their Reach Skill. If the Leader has two Melee Attack options, roll a d6 and add the number of Heroes capable of being targeted by the Leader’s Attack. If the result is 5 or less, use the first option. If the result is 6 or more, use the second option. XI . "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 16 ATTACK: SNIPE Move the Leader the shortest distance to gain Line of Sight to a Hero and be at a higher Elevation level. If tied for choice of target, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. If tied for closest Area to gain Line of Sight and be at a higher Elevation level, choose at random. Then, perform a Ranged Attack on the Hero, gaining the additional Yellow die for Elevation bonus. If the Leader has two Ranged Attack options, roll a d6 and add the number of Heroes that the Leader has Line of Sight to. If the result is 5 or less, use the first option. If the result is 6 or more, use the second option. BLAST Move the Leader to an Area Adjacent to the Hero who has the fewest Villain miniatures in their Area. If tied for choice of Hero, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. If there is more than one possible Area, choose the one with the fewest Villain miniatures in it. If still tied, choose at ran- dom. Then, the Leader performs the Blast Skill with a value of X as shown on the Character tile, affecting their own Area, and the Area with the Hero they moved Adjacent to. ESCORT (X) Move X Minions closest to this Leader into this Leader’s Area. Break ties in favor of Minions whose tiles are in the highest numbered posi- tions in the River. Each activated Minion will spend a maximum of 1 Energy cube for addi- tional movement if required. If there are fewer than X Minions on the Map, move as many as possible. GRENADE Move the Leader to an Area Adjacent to the closest Hero. If tied for closest Hero, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. If tied for choice of Area, choose at random. Then, the Leader resolves the Grenade Skill. HIT & RUN (X) Move the Leader to an Area with the closest Hero. If two or more Heroes are the closest, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. Then, the Leader performs a Melee Attack against the Hero. After resolving the Attack, the Leader gains X Move Points which are used to move away from the Hero. You choose where, applying the Golden Rule (see page 6). MANIPULATE Move the Leader to the Area with the clos- est Villain Objective that requires a Complex Manipulation to advance it. If two or more Objectives are closest, choose at random. Then, the Leader performs a Complex Manipulation on that Objective. If there are multiple options, choose one at random. NOTE: This Task is ignored if there are no Villain Objectives that require Complex Manipulation. MANIPULATE / THOUGHT Move the Leader to the Area with the clos- est Villain Objective that requires a Complex Manipulation/Thought to advance it. If two or more Objectives are closest, choose at ran- dom. Then, the Leader performs a Complex Manipulation/Thought on that Objective. If there are multiple options, choose one at random.

"," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 17 ORDER (X) Move X Minions into the Area of the Hero that is closest to this Leader, selecting the Minions that are closest to the Hero. If two or more Heroes are the closest to the Leader, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. If there is a choice of Minions, choose the ones whose tiles are in the highest numbered positions of the River. Then, each Minion who just moved performs an Attack on the Hero. Each activated Minion will spend a maximum of 1 Energy cube for additional move- ment if required. If a Minion is capable of performing both Ranged and Melee Attacks, or it has more than one type of Ranged or Melee Attack, select one at random using the d6. If a Minion is unable to reach the Area contain- ing the Hero then it moves as close to the Hero as possible, and performs an Attack on the Hero, if able. If there are fewer than X Minions on the Map, move as many as possible. PROTECT Follow the same rules as the Protect Task on the Tile Activation card (see page 11). NOTE: This Task is ignored if there is no active Hero Objective on the Map. RESTORE If the Leader has been Neutralized, return their miniature to the Map following the Reinforcement rules in this book (see page 18). Set their Life Points to half of their original value (rounded up). If the Leader has not been Neutralized, reset their Life Points back to the original value. NOTE: This Task is ignored if the Leader’s Life Points are already at their original value. SNEAK ATTACK Move the Leader to an Area with a Hero where the total Menace Indexes of miniatures allied to the Leader exceeds the total Menace Indexes of enemy miniatures. If tied, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. Then, the Leader performs an Attack (Melee or Ranged) using their Sneak Attack Skill. NOTE: This Task is ignored if there are no valid Areas on the Map that meet the requirement for the Sneak Attack Skill to be used. SPECIAL Refer to the Mission Sheet. STUN The Hero miniature closest to the Leader is placed on its side. If two or more Heroes are the closest, use the Hero Tiebreaker rules. If a Hero is on its side, stand it back up at the start of its next activation/turn. For that activation/turn, their First Movement Bonus is reduced to zero. NOTE: Heroes controlled by a Character tile are stood back up at the start of their next activation. Heroes with Bat-Tablets are stood back up at the start of their next turn only if they choose an Active Stance. THOUGHT Move the Leader to the Area with the clos- est Villain Objective that requires a Complex Thought to advance it. If two or more Objectives are closest, choose at random. Then, the Leader performs a Complex Thought on that Objective. If there are multiple options, choose one at random. NOTE: This Task is ignored if there are no Villain Objectives that require Complex Thought. ","3/3 1/3 0/3  BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 18 EVENT WARNING TILE When the AI activates the Event Warning tile, refer to the Mission sheet to see if there are any specific rules regarding Events and which Event option to select if there are multiple choices. Otherwise select an Event at random. NOTE: If activating the Event Warning tile would have no impact on the game state (e.g. there are no valid Events or no Reinforcement points to spend), move the Event Warning tile to the end of the River without paying for its activation and without activating the tile. Instead, activate the tile that now occupies the position indicated on the AI card, paying the corresponding Energy cost. REINFORCEMENTS When spending Reinforcement points, the AI will prioritize miniatures whose tile is in the lowest numbered position of the River. For each Reinforcement point the AI is unable to spend, move 1 Energy cube from its Fatigue zone to its Reserve Zone, if able. For example, the AI activates the Event Warning tile and has 3 Reinforcement points to spend. The Character pool contains two Brutes with Firearm and two Brutes with Chains. The Brutes with Firearm are lower in the River, so one of them is selected, leaving 1 Reinforcement point, not enough to select a second miniature. Therefore, the AI recovers 1 Energy cube instead. After selecting a miniature to Reinforce, deter- mine where to place it before selecting the next miniature. To determine where a miniature comes into play from Reinforcement, roll a d6. Place the miniature in the Area whose Reinforcement token matches the number rolled. If the number rolled exceeds the highest num- bered Reinforcement token on the Map, place the miniature on a Reinforcement Area closest to the Hero as determined by the text at the top of the Tile Activation card (see Hero Tiebreaker). If the placement of a miniature would cause an Area to be Over-Occupied, roll again to choose another Reinforcement Area. If all available Reinforcement Areas would be Over- Occupied by its placement, place the miniature in an Area Adjacent to the originally rolled Reinforcement Area. If there is more than one, decide randomly. XII .

The AI will Reroll dice from Free Rerolls, the Luck Skill, and the Support Skill. The AI will also pay for up to 1 Reroll during each miniature’s activation, up to the normal limit of spending Energy cubes. The AI will never pay to Reroll a die in Defense, but may still get other Rerolls in Defense from other sources. The AI will never perform a paid Reroll for Complex Manipulations or Complex Thoughts if there is no possibility of succeeding. The AI will only ever Reroll a blank. If it has more than one option for which die to Reroll, it will choose a die in the following order:     For example, A Thug with Firearm attacks a Hero and rolls 2 White dice and 1 Yellow die (for Elevation). Three blanks are rolled! The Thug gets a free Reroll of each of the White dice, getting one blank and one showing 2 Successes. The AI uses its one paid Reroll, spending 1 Energy cube and Rerolling the Yellow die, rolling 1 Success. Their Attack results in a total of 3 Successes. AI REROLLS AND DIRECT DAMAGE Whenever the AI rolls Yellow dice as a result of receiving Wounds from Explosions, the Scream Skill, and Dangerous Terrain, the AI will first use any Free Rerolls to Reroll dice showing 2 Successes if able, followed by dice showing 1 Success. Then, if a Minion is affected, the AI will then perform 1 paid Reroll if exactly 1 Yellow die shows either 1 or 2 Successes and all other Yellow dice are blank (rerolling the Yellow die showing the Successes). If a Leader is affected, the AI will perform 1 paid Reroll of the Yellow die showing the most Successes. XIII . "," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 20 WAYNE MANOR EXPANSION · ELEVATOR When moving between levels/maps with the Elevator, the nomal rules are modified as follows: Villain miniatures can move the Elevator to multiple levels on a single turn. The Elevator tile moves to the last level visited that turn. If a Villain cannot reach a Villain or Hero Objective, as there is not an objective on their current level, they will move to the Elevator. Villains do not need to perform an Automatic Manipulation to call or move the Elevator. A Villain miniature takes the shortest route to the Elevator Shaft and then selects a different level. Place the miniature in the Area directly Adjacent to the Elevator Shaft on that level. When selecting a level to move the miniature to, refer to the Mission sheet. If there are mul- tiple options, choose at random. If the miniature cannot reach the Elevator Shaft Area, move them as close as possible, spending 1 Energy cube to move 1 additional Area, if able. Heroes may leave / enter the Elevator on the Villain’s turn during steps 4-5 of the Elevator movement steps as normal. However, AI min- iatures do not leave / enter the Elevator during the Hero’s turn. XIV .

"," BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES  || SOLO/COOP RULEBOOK || 24 GOTHAM CITY IN FLAMES EXPANSION To play the Gotham City in Flames expansion in either Solo or Coop mode, you will need to have read and understood the Solo/Coop rules as well as the Campaign rules for this expansion. Unless specifically stated here, the Gotham City in Flames Campaign rules apply as written. These Solo/Coop Campaign Mode rules only apply when the rules in Solo/ Coop mode differ from the Campaign rules. HEROES POWERS All Heroes powers act in the same way they are set out in the Campaign rules, with the following modification: When using the Hero Power “Darkness is my Ally” the face down Shadow tokens placed on the Board are treated as Heroes in all respects for the purposes of the Solo/Coop rules. THE ZEPPELIN BOARD The Zeppelin Board has two levels accessed by stairwells. If a Villain miniature does not have a valid target for its current Task on the level of the Zeppelin on which the miniature is situated, or the closest valid target is on the other level of the Zeppelin, then move the Villain miniature towards the closest stairwell and follow the MOVING BETWEEN LEVELS rule as set out in the relevant mission. Remember to follow the Solo/Coop rules and spend one Energy cube to move one additional Area. NEUTRALIZED VILLAINS As per the Solo/Coop mode rules, it is possible for Neutralized Villain miniatures to be returned to the Board. If this occurs, the Heroes do not lose any bonus, including Victory points previously gained from Neutralizing the Villain. In addition, the Heroes cannot gain this bonus a second time if they Neutralize the Villain again. SPECIAL ACTIONS & FEATS The Resolution of any Special Actions or Feats in the Solo/Coop mode is set out in the Mission Summary. DREDGING THE RIVER In certain circumstances during the Missions in this expansion, the Villain is required to Dredge the River. The details of whether, and how, to Dredge the River in these circumstances is covered in the Mission Summary. The Mission Summary takes precedence over the Solo/Coop rules only in these specific circumstances. INFAMY EFFECTS TRAINED ELITE When deciding which tile has a reduced Reinforcement cost, use the d6 to randomly choose between the available options. ADRENALINE SHOT If more than one Leader is included in a Mission use the d6 to randomly select which Leader receives the additional Life Point. XVII .

When instructed to trigger multiple Effects, remember that the Villain is still restricted to a maximum of 3 Infamy Effects. - STEP 1 - THREE-POINT INFAMY EFFECT: Roll d6 and add the Villain’s total available Infamy points to the number rolled. This number is called the “Score”. If the Score is greater than or equal to 9, the Villain will trigger the EXHAUSTION Infamy Effect for 3 Infamy Points. Whether the Villain has triggered this Effect or not, move on to resolving Step 2. - STEP 2 - TWO-POINT INFAMY EFFECTS: Roll d6 and add the Villain’s remaining available Infamy points to the number rolled. This number is called the “Score”. Refer to the table below and resolve the relevant row. SCORE EFFECTS 6 OR LESS Do not trigger any Infamy Effects. Move onto Step 3. 7 Trigger TRAINED ELITE. Move onto Step 3. 8 Trigger BOOST. Move onto Step 3. 9 Trigger EQUIPMENT THEFT or BAT-GADGET THEFT. Determine randomly. Move onto Step 3. 10 - 11 Trigger 2 Effects from: TRAINED ELITE, BOOST, EQUIPMENT THEFT and BAT-GADGET THEFT. Determine which two to trigger randomly. If the Villains has triggered 3 Infamy Effects at this point, Skip Steps 3 and 4. 12 OR GREATER Trigger 3 Effects from: TRAINED ELITE, BOOST, EQUIPMENT THEFT and BAT-GADGET THEFT. Determine which three to trigger randomly. Skip Steps 3 and 4.

This number is called the “Score”. Refer to the table below and resolve the relevant row. SCORE EFFECTS 2 - 4 Do not trigger any further Infamy Effects. 5 Trigger ADRENALINE SHOT. 6 Trigger JACK OF ALL TRADES. 7 Trigger SABOTAGE. 8 Trigger 2 Effects from: ADRENALINE SHOT, JACK OF ALL TRADES and SABOTAGE. Determine which two to trigger randomly. 9 OR GREATER Trigger all 3 Effects: ADRENALINE SHOT, JACK OF ALL TRADES and SABOTAGE.
