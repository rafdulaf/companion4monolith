She was slender, yet formed like a goddess: at once lithe and voluptuous. Her only garment was a broad silken girdle. Her white ivory limbs and the ivory globes of her breasts drove a beat of fierce passion through the Cimmerian’s pulse, even in the panting fury of battle. Her rich black hair, black as a Stygian night, fell in rippling burnished clusters down her supple back. Her dark eyes burned on the Cimmerian.\nShe was untamed as a desert wind, supple and dangerous as a she-panther.",

His black mane was matted with mud and clotted blood ; there were streaks of dried blood on his chest and limbs, dried blood on the long straight sword he gripped in his right hand. From under the tangle of his locks, bloodshot eyes glared like coals of blue fire. ",

She might have been looking into a mirror which subtly altered her reflection, lending it a tigerish gleam of eye, a vindictive curl of lip.\n“Ishtar!” gasped Taramis. “I am bewitched!”\n“Bewitched? No, sweet sister!”\n“Sister? I have no sister.”\nSalome laughed fiercely, and slapped her bosom. Between her breasts shone a crescent, red as blood.\n“The mark of the witch!” cried Taramis, recoiling.\n“Aye! The curse of the kings of Khauran! They tell how the first queen of our line had traffic with a fiend of darkness and bore him a daughter who lives in foul legendry to this day. And thereafter in each century a girl baby was born with a scarlet half-moon between her breasts, that signified her destiny. ‘Every century a witch shall be born.’ So ran the ancient curse. And so it has come to pass.\n“Well, this world contains all I desire – power, and pomp, and glittering pageantry, handsome men and soft women for my paramours and my slaves. I have returned to take that to which I have as much right as you.”",

She was all woman, in spite of her bearing and her garments. Instead of a skirt she wore short, wide-legged silk breeches, which ceased a hand’s breadth short of her knees, and were upheld by a wide silken sash worn as a girdle. Flaring-topped boots of soft leather came almost to her knees, and a low-necked, wide-collared, wide-sleeved silk shirt completed her costume. There was the color of the sea in her wide eyes. And that was as it should have been, because this was Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, whose deeds are celebrated in song and ballad wherever seafarers gather.\n“Why won’t men let me live a man’s life?”\n“No living man could disarm Valeria of the Brotherhood with his bare hands.”",
