["The Conan board game already has two main game modes and dozens of scenarios that allow players to live glorious adventures in the world of the Cimmerian: the Adventure mode, which is the classic game mode, and the Solo/Coop mode introduced with the Conqueror expansion. With the Versus mode, we want to expand even further the potential of the King Pledge by offering intense battles in which we invite two players to compete, each equipped with a Book of Skelos. The great novelty of this mode is that each player will be able to recruit their own troops in order to increase their chances of winning. The Versus mode still relies on scenar- ios for greater immersion and to provide a context for the upcoming duels, leaving players free to decide on their tactics and the best way to crush their enemy! To enjoy the Versus mode, players will need to master the rules of the Overlord as described in the Overlord’s Book of the Adventure mode. 2 2 2 2 Mummies Mummies 2 2 1 1 Bossonian Guards Bossonian Guards 3 3 Zogar Sag Zogar Sag 3 1 1 1 Bêlit’s Guards Bêlit’s Guards 2 1 2 2 Pict archers Pict archers 2 5 0 1 1 Hyenas Hyenas 3 1 1 1 Pirates Pirates 2 2 2 2 Pict warriors Pict warriors 3 3 Conan Conan 2 3 2 2 Mummies Mummies 2 1 1 1 Skeletons Skeletons 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters A New Mode Versus Mode ","7 A Bossonian Guard rolls 2 orange dice to determine his defense power. The Overlord’s rules evolve in Versus mode to allow two players to command their troops, each with their own Book of Skelos. However, the core of the game system remains the same as that of the Overlord in Adventure mode. That is why only the rules that are modified or added will be described in this booklet, for simplicity, and to allow you to start your first game quicker. If a rule or part of a rule is not explicitly modified in this booklet, it remains identical to that of the Overlord’s Book. Player’s side Unlike Adventure and Solo/Coop modes, the armies in Versus mode can see units with very different allegiances fighting side by side due to the recruitment left to the players’ choice. Zogar Sag may command Bossonian Guards, just as Conan may find himself at the head of an army mixing Picts, Pirates, and Mummies. Therefore, players are now named General and Warlord in Versus mode. At the beginning of the game, players must agree on the side they will play. We suggest playing each side in turn, as scenarios often present different tactics for the General and the Warlord. Benefits Exertion Limits Benefits now have an exertion limit. The number of gems a player can assign to a Benefit zone during a single turn is therefore limited. Movement When a player spends a gem on the Movement benefit to purchase an additional movement point, each unit of the active Unit tile gains an additional movement point. Each unit on the active tile gains 2 extra movement points. Demobilization At any time during their turn, a player can demobilize a Unit tile from their River. To do this, 2 gems are removed first from their Fatigue zone and permanently returned to the game box. The chosen Unit tile and all units associated with that tile are also permanently returned to the game box. A player can demobilize only one tile per game. Armor Value The Armor value of a Unit tile no longer represents a fixed defense value. When a unit defends, the player controlling that unit rolls a number of equal to the Armor value. The result of this dice roll is the defense power of that unit. Defend a unit Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, it is always the opponent of the player making an attack who rolls for defense, whether the unit targeted by the attack is one of their own units or a neutral unit in the scenario. Asset Cards Asset cards are not used in the Versus Mode. Spell Cards The text of some Spell cards has been modified to make them compatible with the Versus mode. These cards are distinguished from their Adventure version by the red background and must be used instead. Note: In each scenario, Versus mode Spell cards’ names are followed by “(vs)”. Set’s Bite Target a unit in your line of sight. The player controlling the target moves 1 gem from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone, and the target suffers unavoidable damage. 2 2 Skills Some skills need to be modified to be compatible with the Versus mode. The list of modified skills can be found on the last page of this booklet. The skills that are not listed there remain unchanged. RULES CHANGES ","8 Occupied Areas An adjacent area is considered occupied for the active unit: • if that unit’s miniature cannot entirely fit in that area, • or if the area in which the unit’s miniature is located is already occupied. In this example, the Guard can perform a Melee Attack targeting Skuthus (just like in the rules for the Adventure and the Solo/coop modes), but Skuthus can also perform a Melee attack against the Guard. Tokens Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, tokens in an area never count towards determining if that area is occupied. End-game Each scenario indicates one or several end-of-game condi- tions. These conditions must be constantly evaluated by the players to determine whether the game should continue or not. When at least one condition is met, the game ends and the victory conditions are then evaluated to designate a winner. Automatic defeat If a player no longer has any units on the game board, they immediately lose the game, regardless of the end-of-game or victory conditions. Army Recruitment After selecting a scenario and assigning sides, the players can now recruit the forces that will constitute their armies. Level of a Unit tile Unit tiles now all have a level determined by their reinforcement cost. Players can use all the tiles at their disposal wherever they are from (add-on, expansion, etc.). Banned Units: Players cannot recruit Unit tiles with an Armor value of 5 or greater. Leader Champion Minion 3 3 Zogar Sag Zogar Sag 2 2 2 2 Pict warriors Pict warriors 2 2 1 1 Bossonian Guards Bossonian Guards Army Composition Each scenario indicates which side has the initiative, as well as the army composition of the General and Warlord, with the following details for each: • the position of each tile in their River, • the level of each tile the player can recruit, • the number of units associated with each tile. The army composition may be different for the General and the Warlord. Unit positions The scenario map also indicates the area of the board where the units of each tile start the game. Each numbered gem corresponds to one of the units from the Unit tile placed in that position in the River. ","9 Leader Recruitment Starting with the side with the initiative, each player will first recruit a Leader-level Unit tile from those available to them. This unit is central to the army composition, and it is recommended to choose carefully. 3 3 Zogar Sag Zogar Sag Once their Leader has been chosen, the players place their Leader’s Unit tile in the position of the River indicated by the army composition. 3 3 Zogar Sag Zogar Sag Then, they take the associated miniature and place it in the area indicated on the scenario’s setup diagram (p. 8 “Units positions”). Next, players place the Leader’s Life Point token on the “4” space of the Turn track. Leaders always start the game with 4 life points. Finally, if their Leader has the Spell Caster skill, players may choose one or two Spell cards from those indicated by the scenario, starting with the side who has the initiative. 3 3 Zogar Sag Zogar Sag Some scenarios list one or two Spell cards available for both the General and the Warlord. The name of these Spell cards is underlined to indicate it. When such a Spell card is chosen by a player, that player owns it for the duration of the game and it cannot be used by their opponent. Champions and Minions recruitment After selecting their Leader, players recruit the rest of their army by choosing a Unit tile in turn, starting with the side who has initiative and respecting the army composition imposed by the scenario. When a Champion or Minion tile is recruited, it is placed in the position of the River indicated by the army composition. Then, the number of units miniatures indicated by the army composition is taken from the game box, and these minia- tures are placed as indicated on the scenario setup diagram (p. 8 “Units positions”). Event tile In each scenario, the Event tile allows the immediate acti- vation of the Leader. In this case, the Leader tile is not moved to the end of the River and the activation is carried out normally. "]
