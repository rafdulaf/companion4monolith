["Heroes’ Book V2.1 ","Greetings adventurer! Know, oh prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an Age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars—Nemedia, Ophir, Brythunia, Hyperborea, Zamora with its dark-haired women and towers of spider-haunted mystery, Zingara with its chivalry, Koth that bordered on the pastoral lands of Shem, Stygia with its shadow-guarded tombs, Hyrkania whose riders wore steel and silk and gold. But the proudest kingdom of the world was Aquilonia, reigning supreme in the dreaming west. Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet. - The Nemedian Chronicles, Robert E. Howard. Overview Conan is a miniatures board game for 2 to 5 players in which you join the famous barbarian in his adventures and relive his most glorious battles through an asymmetric and open gameplay system. Each game pits two sides against each other: one player takes on the role of the “Overlord” and controls evil hordes to carry out his vile plans, while the other players embody different unique Heroes who cooperate to achieve their goals. Each game of Conan revolves around a scenario. Each scenario details the location it takes place in, the mission’s context, the necessary setup instructions, as well as the objectives for either side to achieve victory. Each Hero has a Hero sheet that allows them to control their miniature on the battlefield by performing various actions such as moving, fighting, defending or picking a chest lock. The Heroes must play cooperatively to perform their actions in the most efficient way possible while defending themselves from the Overlord’s onslaught. Unlike the Heroes who each control a single unit, the Overlord uses a tablet, called the Book of Skelos, which allows them to control a multitude of units. The Overlord’s troops are represented by tiles that group units whose attributes are identical and act simultaneously, such as a band of Pict Warriors or a crew of Pirates. Sometimes a tile represents a single central unit from the scenario, like the terrible sorcerer Zogar Sag or the ruthless Captain Zaporavo. 2 ","Contents Models x74 (Barbarian) / x106 (King*) Each hero has a dark gray plastic miniature used to represent them on the game board. The Overlord’s units are represented by lighter gray miniatures. Rulebooks x2 This Heroes’ Book and the Overlord’s Book include the rules of the game for each side, as well as descriptions and setup instructions for the scenarios. Gems x75 Gems are used to determine how much energy is available to the Heroes (blue gems) and the Overlord (red gems). Each gem represents one unit of energy. Dice x9 (Barbarian) / x15 (King*) They are used to resolve actions such as attacking or defending. Each axe symbol on a face represents one success. The dice come in three colors to indicate the chances of rolling successes. In order: yellow is the least likely to roll successes, followed by orange, and finally red, which has the best chances of rolling successes. Double-sided Board x2 Each game board is double-sided and represents a battlefield for the Heroes and the Overlord. Each board is divided into areas in which the miniatures operate. Each scenario indicates which game board to use. Turn Track x1 Numbered from 0 to 15, it is used to keep track of the number of turns played in a scenario as well as the number of life points for the Overlord’s main units. In specific scenarios, the Turn track might have additional uses. Turn Marker x1 It is placed on the Turn track and indicates the number of turns played in a scenario. The Turn marker advances one space at the start of the Overlord’s turn (see Overlord’s Book). Overlord’s tiles x45 (Barbarian) / x62 (King*) These tiles represent a specific unit or a group of identical units controlled by the Overlord. The Overlord’s Book explains how to use them in detail. 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters ","Book of Skelos x1 This is the board used by the Overlord to control their units. The Overlord’s Book explains how to use it in detail. Spell Cards x16 Certain characters have mastered magical arcana and are able to cast powerful spells. The spell cards available to a unit are listed in the scenario and are placed faceup next to their Hero sheet, or next to the Book of Skelos if that unit is controlled by the Overlord. The rules for spells are described on page 16. Spell cards have the following features: Name, Icon, Energy Cost, Exertion Limit, Effect, Icons: indicates that the spell is an area attack that affects an entire area and all miniatures within it (the spell caster and all friendly and enemy units). indicates that the spell is a reaction spell that can be cast anytime during an opponent’s turn. Asset cards x39 These cards represent the equipment, weapons, and items that the Heroes can use during their mission. Shuffle the cards specified by the scenario to create an “Asset deck”. When a player acquires a piece of equipment, they place the card faceup next to their Hero sheet or next to the Book of Skelos in the Overlord’s case. • Weapon cards have the following features: Name. Illustration. Encumbrance Value. Weapon cards also have one or more bonuses: Melee Attack Bonus. Guard bonus. Ranged Attack Bonus. Some weapons can be used for Melee and Ranged Attacks. They have a icon next to their Ranged Attack bonus. Once a weapon is used for its Ranged Attack bonus, its card is placed in the defender’s area. It needs to be picked up (by performing a simple Manipulation) before it can be used again. The arrow on a die icon means that the player may reroll one die of the matching type once for free (without performing a Reroll action). 1 2 3 4 5 6 Pestilential Swarm Attack your area, ex- cluding yourself and undead characters; roll .

Encumbrance Value. Icons describing the item’s use. Using an item is a free action (i.e. do not assign gems to an Action space) unless specified otherwise. Skill Game Aids x4 They explain the meaning of each skill icon that appears on the Heroes’ sheets and the Overlord’s tiles. Colored Bases x25 These bases come in 5 different colors and are clipped to the Overlord’s miniatures to indicate which tile they are associated with (the color of the bases must match the tile’s colored border.) Life Point Tokens x10 (Barbarian) / x13 (King*) There is a Life Point token for each Overlord unit that has a life point value as indicated in each scenario below the Overlord’s River. The Life Point token is placed on the Turn track and moves towards “0” each time that unit is wounded or towards “15” each time they are healed. Other units controlled by the Overlord (Pict Hunters, Pirates, etc.) have 1 life point and no Life Point token. Reinforcement Tokens x6 (Barbarian) / x9 (King*) These tokens are placed on the board as specified by the scenario to indicate the areas in which the Overlord’s reinforcements will appear. Halo Tokens x2 When a unit (Hero or Overlord miniature) casts a “Mitra’s Halo” or “Set’s Halo” spell, they place one of these tokens around that miniature’s base. Remove the token when the spell ends. Chest Tokens x10 These tokens are placed on the board as specified by the scenario to indicate the areas in which there is a chest. Remove the token from the board once the chest is open. Door Tokens x12 These tokens are placed on the board as specified by the scenario to indicate where doors are located on the board. Life Potion The Life Potion Item card is special because it does not work like other items: • An Aggressive Hero (see page 8) can use it (without assigning any energy gems, just like any Item) to move 2 gems from their Fatigue zone or Wound zone to their Reserve zone, • Then this card is discarded to the game box. 2 2 0 life Potion life Potion Ambidextrous: When this character performs a Melee Attack, the character can choose 2 of their 1-handed weapon cards to attack with. Counterattack: When a character attacks this character with a Melee Attack, after the attack is resolved, this character may immediately attack that character with a free unarmed Melee Attack, rolling instead of their normal dice. Circular Strike: When this character kills an enemy character with a 2-handed Melee Attack, another enemy character in the same area suffers the excess damage from the attack (if that character is killed, repeat this process). Elite Shooter: This character’s Ranged Attacks are not affected by hindering and ignore Protected. Precision Shot: When this character performs a Ranged Attack, the defender’s armor value is reduced by 1 for that attack. Attack From Beyond: When this character dies, before the model is removed from the board, the character may perform a free unarmed Melee Attack, rolling instead of their normal dice. Precision strike: When this character performs a Melee Attack, the defender’s armor value is reduced by 1 for that attack. Constriction: When this character’s attack power is determined, if any die shows 2 or more symbols, move the attacker’s and defender’s models together so their bases touch. As long as they remain in the same area, the defender treats the attacker as though the attacker had Blocking. Attack Skills Reach: This character can attack a character in an adjacent area with a Melee Attack if there is no obstacle (wall, door, bar, ﬂap, etc.) between the characters’ areas. 1 explosive orb explosive orb 1 2 3 4 Mitra’s Halo Set’s Halo (*) The King version of the core box is the one that was available during the Kickstarter campaign. 5 ","Numbered Tokens x13 Barrel Tokens x6 Stairs Tokens x4 Treasure Tokens x13 Flame Tokens x12 (Barbarian) / x16 (King*) “Wall Wrecker” Tokens x6 (Barbarian) / x9 (King*) Web Tokens x3 Water Tokens x6 Boulders Tokens x4 Barricade Life Point Tokens x3 The tokens used with the Book of Skelos are described in the Overlords Book.

Alarm Token x1 6 ","Each Hero has a sheet with their name, Action spaces, Recovery chart, Skill spaces, Encumbrance chart and Energy zones. Action Spaces These spaces represent the 6 actions a Hero can perform and indicate their exertion limit and the Hero’s attribute for each action. The attribute’s level is indicated by the color of the die associated with the action, or by the base movement value in the case of the Move action (see page 15). Recovery Chart This shows the number of gems a Hero recovers according to their stance and the number of fallen Heroes (see page 8). Encumbrance Limit This indicates a Hero’s maximum Encumbrance (see page 19). Skill Spaces These represent a Hero’s special talents. The description of each skill can be found on the skill game aids. The red number in the lower-right corner of each skill indicates the Encumbrance level from which the Hero stops being able to use that skill (see page 19). Encumbrance Chart This shows the Encumbrance level from which the Hero starts losing points from their base movement value (see page 19). Reserve Zone The Reserve zone contains the Hero’s available energy gems, which can be assigned to perform actions. At the start of the game, place as many blue gems as indicated by the number in the lower-left corner of this zone. This represents both the Hero’s potential for action and their life points. Fatigue Zone The Fatigue zone contains gems that the Hero has used and can later recover. During the Hero’s Stance phase, each Hero moves a number of gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone based on their stance (see page 8). Wound Zone The Wound zone contains gems that the Hero has lost from suffering damage. Each time a Hero suffers an amount of damage, the Hero moves that many gems from their Fatigue zone to their Wound zone. If there is more damage to suffer after moving all gems from the Fatigue zone, move gems from the Hero’s Action spaces, Spell cards, and Ally tiles. If there is still more damage to suffer after moving all gems from Action spaces, Spell cards, and Ally tiles, the player moves gems from their Reserve zone. When all of their gems are in the Hero’ s Wound zone, the Hero dies. Drop their Asset cards in their area on the board, and remove their miniature from the board.

Calculating Damage Damage is equal to the Attack Power (the number of symbols rolled by the attacker) minus the unit’s Defense Power (see page 11–12). Damage = Attack Power - Defense Power (Guard + Armor) 7 ","In Conan, two sides cross swords: the Heroes who play together against the Overlord, sole master of their own units. Both sides take turns playing, starting with the side specified by the scenario. In Conan, Heroes perform actions in any order, coordinating and alternating among themselves as they choose until all Heroes decide to stop acting and end their turn (because they no longer have any gems available or because they wish to save some for future turns). Then it is the Overlord’s turn. On their turn, the Overlord may activate 0, 1, or 2 tiles in the River to move their units and attack the Heroes. Each tile represents a miniature or a group of miniatures that the Overlord takes control of when activating this tile. Once the Overlord has completed their activations, the Heroes take their turn. The two sides thus alternate until one of them completes their objective to win the game as indicated by the scenario. The Heroes’ turn consists of four phases that take place in the following order: 1. Start Phase 2. Stance Phase 3. Action Phase 4. End Phase 1. Start Phase All energy gems spent by the Heroes during the Overlord’s turn are moved to their Fatigue zone. 2. Stance Phase Each player chooses their Hero’s stance for the next Action phase. A Hero’s stance will either be Aggressive or Cautious. If the Hero chooses an Aggressive stance, they place their stance marker (a red gem) on the . The Hero then moves a number of gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone as indicated: if no Heroes have died, the Hero moves two gems; if one Hero has died, the Hero moves three gems; if two or more Heroes have died, the Hero moves four gems. An Aggressive Hero can perform any action during the Action phase as long as they can assign gems. If the Hero chooses a Cautious stance, they place their stance marker (a red gem) on the . The Hero then moves a number of gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone as indicated: if no Heroes have died, the Hero moves five gems; if one Hero has died, the Hero moves six gems; if two or more Heroes have died, the Hero moves seven gems. A Cautious Hero can perform only Guard and Reroll actions. A Cautious Hero cannot perform Melee Attack, Ranged Attack, Manipulation, and Move actions. They also cannot drop an object or cast a spell (unless it is a reaction spell). Turn Structure The Heroes´ Turn 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 ","5 5 2 1 3. Action Phase Once all the Heroes have chosen their stance, the Aggressive Heroes may perform the actions of their choice. During the Action phase, Heroes do not act according to a defined turn order, instead they freely coordinate each of their actions. Thus, a Hero can perform any actions they want (such as attacking, moving, or attempting to open a chest), then hand the turn to one of their companion. The next Hero may then perform a certain number of actions before they also hand the turn over to another Hero or to one that has already acted previously and so on. The phase ends when Heroes cannot or choose not to perform any further actions. (The Heroes may want to keep some gems in their Reserve zone to help defend against the Overlord’s attacks.) Here is a list of actions a Hero may perform: Melee Attack To perform a Melee Attack action, the Hero targets one enemy in their area (or sometimes in an adjacent area; see Occupied Areas, page 22) and assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to their Melee Attack space. The Hero may choose one of their Weapon cards that has a Melee Attack bonus to attack with. Then, for each gem assigned, the Hero rolls one die of the type indicated on their Melee Attack space 1 plus the dice indicated on the chosen Weapon card. After resolving any rerolls, the Hero determines the attack power by adding up the number of successes shown on the dice. A Hero can perform the Melee Attack action more than once during the Action phase to attack the same or different targets. However, a player cannot assign gems to a space if doing so would raise the total number of gems on the space above its exertion limit, as indicated by the red number in the lower-left corner of the Action space 2 . Unarmed Attacks When a Hero performs a Melee Attack action without a Weapon card, the attack is considered to be unarmed. In this case, their attack power is reduced by 2. Attacks made by the Overlord’s units are never considered to be unarmed. Hindering The Melee Attack action is not affected by hindering (see page 17–18). S hevatas encounters a Guard on the ship’s deck. Since the Guard has an Armor value of 2 and 1 life point, Shevatas will need to cause at least 3 damage to defeat the Guard. • He chooses to assign two energy gems to his Melee Attack space, which will allow him to roll . • Also, because he is performing this Melee Attack with a Kris, he rolls as well. The arrow on the yellow die icon means that Shevatas can reroll any yellow die in his attack once for free. 4 4 10 • The attack power is 4, so he decides not to reroll the and keeps his roll as-is for this attack. Shevatas will later be able to perform another Melee Attack action during this Action phase as long as he does not go over his exertion limit of 4. This means that he could attack twice by assigning 1 gem for each attack, or once by assigning 2 gems on a single strike. • He rolls the dice: + 1 + + Kris Kris 9 ","To perform a Ranged Attack, the Hero must first choose one of their Weapon cards that has a Ranged Attack bonus to attack with. Then they assign one or more gems from their Reserve zone to their Ranged Attack space, and target one enemy in their line of sight. To determine line of sight, trace an imaginary line from the in the attacker’s area to the in the chosen enemy’s area. If this line crosses an obstacle shown on the board (a wall, a door, a mast, etc.), the line is blocked and that area is not in the attacker’s line of sight. Otherwise, the attacker has line of sight to that area. A unit always has line of sight to its own area. Friendly or enemy units do not block line of sight but can hinder Ranged Attacks (see page 17–18). The distance between two areas does not affect line of sight. For each gem assigned, the Hero rolls one die of the type indicated on their Ranged Attack space 1 , plus the dice indicated on the chosen Weapon card. After resolving any rerolls, the Hero determines the attack power by adding up the number of successes shown on the dice. If the chosen weapon has next to its Ranged Attack bonus, the attacker drops the weapon in the defender’s area at the end of the attack. A Hero can perform the Ranged Attack action more than once during the Action phase to attack the same or different targets. However, a player cannot assign gems to a space if doing so would raise the total number of gems on the space above its exertion limit, as indicated by the red number in the lower-left corner of the Action space 2 . 4 4 2 1 Hindering The Ranged Attack action is affected by hindering unless specified otherwise (see page 17–18). 3 + + Battle Axe Battle Axe C onan has been tasked with infiltrating a Pict village to kill Zogar Sag, the evil Pict sorcerer. At this point, Conan’s quarry is in an adjacent area, but the barbarian is pinned by the Giant Snake (who has the Blocking skill). • The attack power is 4, and the Battle Axe card is now lying in Zogar Sag’s area. • Since Conan is unable to move from his current area, he opts to hurl his Battle Axe at Zogar Sag’s head. He assigns three energy gems to his Ranged Attack space, which allows him to roll . Also, because he is performing this Ranged Attack with a Battle Axe, he rolls as well. He rolls the dice: Ranged Attack 4 4 + 3 + + Battle Axe Battle Axe 10 ","Elevation and Line of Sight As a general rule, in the case of an abrupt change in elevation, only the areas directly overhanging share a line of sight with the areas below. If two areas are of different elevation levels, for a line of sight to exist between them, the imaginary line cannot cross any area with an elevation level equal to or higher than the higher level of the two areas. When line of sight is in doubt, players should use their best judgment to determine if line of sight exists, or refer to the online Conan Companion (https://companion.the-overlord.com/Conan/). Elevation Bonus for Ranged Attacks When a unit (Hero or Overlord) attacks an enemy at a lower elevation using a Ranged Attack, the attacker rolls an extra . Hindering The Guard action is not affected by hindering (see page 17–18). When a Hero is attacked, after the attack power is determined, the Hero may defend against the attack. The Hero chooses whether or not to perform a Guard action. To perform a Guard action, the Hero assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to their Guard space. The Hero may then choose one of their Asset cards that has a Guard bonus to defend with, such as a weapon or shield. If the Hero chooses to defend with one of their Asset cards, they are considered to be parrying. Otherwise, the Hero is considered to be dodging. A Hero can choose only a shield when parrying a Ranged Attack, area attack, or a spell. Without a shield, these attacks can only be dodged. For each gem assigned, the Hero rolls one die of the type indicated on their Guard space 1 , plus the dice indicated on the chosen Weapon card, and their Armor if they have one (see page 12). After resolving any rerolls, the Hero determines the defense power by adding up the number of successes shown on the dice. A Guard action is only effective against a single attack unless specified otherwise. 1 Guard 11 ","• Having no shield or weapon to parry with, Shevatas performs the Guard action to attempt to dodge the attack. He assigns two energy gems to his Guard space, allowing him to roll . He rolls the dice, obtaining two successes. His defense power is 2. • The thief suffers 3 damage from this attack and moves 3 gems to his Wound zone. S hevatas confronts the Giant Snake, who lunges at him: • The Giant Snake’s attack has a power of 5. = - A Guard takes a swing at Conan with an attack power of 1: He decides to assign an energy gem to his Guard space to roll an orange die . He also rolls a thanks to his Leather Armor that protects him from every attack. • He rolls the dice: • He suffers 1 damage. Armor Asset cards like leather armors and other protections are what essentially grant Armor. It’s a “minimum default” defense that is a free action (not requiring any spending of energy) and which a Hero benefits from automatically for each attack they suffer when they have such an equipment. Whether a Hero uses a Guard action or not (see page 11), they still benefit from the Armor of one of their Asset cards with the Armor bonus when calculating their defense power. However, they must declare whether or not they Guard before using their Armor. 12 ","Hindering Simple Manipulations are not affected by hindering (see page 17–18). Complex Manipulations are affected by hindering (see page 17–18). Throwing and Catching an Object To throw an object, the Hero chooses one of their objects that has an Encumbrance value of 3 or less and an area in their line of sight (see page 10). The Hero performs a complex Manipulation that has a difficulty equal to the distance from the Hero to the chosen area. If the Hero succeeds, the Hero drops the object in the chosen area. If the Hero fails, the Hero drops the object a number of areas away equal to the manipulation power, following the line of sight to the chosen area. When the object is dropped in an area, one Hero in that area may immediately perform a simple manipulation to catch the object or pick it up. Dropping an Object A Hero can drop one of their objects in their area as a free action (without assigning gems). If an object with an area effect is dropped, the effect is resolved as if the object had been thrown. Opening a Chest Chests require a complex Manipulation with a difficulty of 2 to open, unless the scenario specifies otherwise. To pick a chest’s lock, a Hero must be in the chest’s area. If the Hero succeeds, the Hero removes the chest from the board, takes the top card of the Asset deck and places it faceup next to their Hero sheet. When a Hero opens a chest, they can choose not to claim its content right away, in which case the top card of the Asset deck is placed in the chest’s area, and it can be picked up later by performing a simple Manipulation. The Manipulation action encompasses a wide range of activities, from throw- ing an object to picking a lock. There are two types of Manipulation actions: simple and complex. • To perform a simple Manipulation, the Hero assigns one gem from their Reserve zone to their Manipulation space (but rolls no dice). To pick up, give, take, or catch an object, a Hero performs a simple Manipulation. Objects include Weapon and Item cards, as well as anything specified by the scenario. Whenever a Hero wants to give an object to another Hero, one of the two performs a simple Manipulation, that object is im- mediately equipped by the Hero who takes it. • To perform a complex Manipulation, the Hero as- signs one or more gems from their Reserve zone to their Ma- nipulation space and may choose one of their Asset cards that has a Manipulation bonus. For each gem assigned, the Hero rolls one die of the type indicated on their Manipulation space 1 , plus the dice indicated on the chosen card. The ma- nipulation power is equal to the number of successes shown on the dice. Complex Manipulations have a difficulty defined by the scenario. If the manipulation power is equal to or high- er than the Manipulation’s difficulty, the Hero succeeds at the Manipulation. Otherwise, the Hero fails the Manipulation. A Hero can perform the Manipulation action more than once during the Action phase. However, a player cannot assign gems to a space if doing so would raise the total number of gems on the space above its exertion limit, as indicated by the red number in the lower-left corner of the Action space 2 . 3 3 2 1 Manipulation 13 ","Hindering The Reroll action is not affected by hindering (see page 17–18). A Hero can perform Reroll actions after rolling dice but before finalizing the results of the roll. To perform a Reroll, the Hero assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to their Reroll space. The Hero then rerolls that many dice. A Hero can perform the Reroll action multiple times and may reroll the same dice or different dice each time. Reroll • His three successes are more than enough to allow him to open the chest and discover what treasures lie within. C onan is alone in a Pict hut with a chest. Since no one is hindering him, if he obtains at least two successes, he can pick the lock and immediately claim its contents. • He decides to assign two energy gems to his Manipulation space and rolls the dice, but does not obtain enough successes. • He chooses to reroll the blank die by assigning one gem to his Reroll space, obtaining yet another blank result. 3 3 • He elects to reroll again, assigning one more gem to his Reroll space, and this time he finally obtains a favorable result. = 14 ","2 4 4 2 1 Hindering The Move action is affected by hindering (see page 17–18). • Then he moves. He must move from one area to another (cost: 1 movement point), step through the hut’s entrance (extra movement cost: +1 movement point), and factor in the presence of the last guard in his starting area hindering his move (extra movement cost: +1 movement point). It will cost him a total of 3 movement points. The first 2 points come from his base movement value, and the last point requires that he assigns a gem to his Move space. • The Action phase starts and Conan decides to rid himself of a few enemies first by using a Circular Strike with his axe, killing two of them. 3 C onan is surrounded by three Guards in an area of the village. He wants to enter an adjacent hut. A unit (Hero or Overlord miniature) must spend one movement point to move across a border from one area to an adjacent area. Hindering and some terrain effects can increase the number of movement points required to cross a border (see page 17-18). All Heroes have a base movement value 1 . At the start of the Action phase, an Aggressive Hero gains a number of movement points equal to their base movement value. These movement points are free; they do not require the Hero to assign gems to the Move action. As a result, the first movement points a unit spends are the movement points gained thanks to their base movement value. Each turn, when a Hero stops moving to perform an action other than a Move, the Hero loses all of their remaining movement points. However, the Hero can still perform a Move action to gain movement points that turn. To perform the Move action, the Hero assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to their Move space. For each assigned gem, the Hero gains 1 movement point that must be spent immediately. A player cannot assign gems to a space if doing so would raise the total number of gems on the space above its exertion limit 2 . At the end of the Action phase, all unspent movement points are lost. Note : In Conan, a Hero performs their actions in any order they want. They may start their Action phase by attacking an enemy, and then move away using their base movement points since it is their first Move action this turn. Move 15 ","A Hero’s Spell cards are placed face up near their Hero sheet. Casting a spell is an action. To cast one of their spells, a Hero assigns a number of gems equal to the spell’s cost 1 from their Reserve zone to that card. The number of gems placed on the card cannot exceed the spell’s exertion limit 2 . Some spells function as attacks, and specify what they attack and which dice to roll. The caster determines the attack power by adding up the number of successes rolled. Units defend against and suffer damage from spell attacks as they would against other attacks, but Guard bonuses from Weapon cards cannot be used to defend. At the end of each turn, during the End phase, each player moves all gems from their Spell cards to their Fatigue zone. Casting a spell Once all the Heroes have finished performing actions, each Hero moves all gems from their Action spaces, Allies’ tiles, Spell cards… to their Fatigue zone. Play then proceeds with the Overlord’s turn. 4. End Phase Pestilential Swarm Attack your area, ex- cluding yourself and undead characters; roll . Char- acters cannot defend against this attack. Attacked characters suffer damage equal to the attack power. 3 3 2 1 Hindering Casting a spell is not affected by hindering (see page 17–18). Attacking with a Hero The Hero: - chooses an enemy they want to attack, - assigns a number of gems to their Melee or Ranged Attack space (it cannot be modified later), - chooses a weapon to attack with (or perform an unarmed attack), - rolls the dice, - uses any free rerolls and/or perform any Reroll actions, - applies any penalties from hindering and unarmed attack, - determines the attack power. At this point, the attack power can no longer be modified. Defending with a Hero The Hero: - casts reaction spells or uses skills that can be used in reaction to the attack (Sacrifice, Mitra’s Halo, etc.), - chooses whether or not to perform a Guard action and assigns a number of gems to their Guard space (this cannot be modified later), - chooses a weapon or shield to parry, - adds any dice from Armor, - rolls the dice, - uses any free rerolls and/or perform any Reroll actions, - determines the defense power. At this point, the defense power can no longer be modified, - determines how much damage they suffer. 16 ","When a Hero moves or performs an action in an area in which the number of enemy units is equal to or higher than the total number of friendly units, that Hero may be affected by hindering. It affects movement and all actions requiring dice rolls, except in the cases indicated previously (Melee Attack, Defense, Reroll, simple Manipulation, and Casting a spell). Hindering Movement When moving out of an area, a unit must spend 1 extra movement point for each enemy unit equal to or greater than the number of friendly units in that area. Important: The Overlord’s units are also affected by hindering. C onan and Hadrathus are in the same area as one enemy. There are fewer enemies than Heroes in the area. Thus, Conan can leave the area without suffering a penalty while Hadrathus keeps the enemy “busy”. However, as soon as Conan leaves the area, Hadrathus will be hindered by the enemy if he were to move. +1 C onan is in the same area as one enemy. Thus he has to spend 1 extra movement point to move out of that area. Hindering +2 +3 C onan and Hadrathus are in the same area as three enemies. There are more enemies than Heroes in this area. Thus, Conan must spend 2 extra movement points to move out of his area (for a total of 3 movement points). After Conan moves out of the area, Hadrathus is left with three enemies in the same space. Thus, he would have to spend 3 extra movement points to move out of the area (for a total of 4 movement points). 17 ","C onan is in the same area as three enemies and he attempts to pick the lock on a chest. Because of hindering, three successes are ignored. So, if this lock would have required two successes to be opened, Conan would need five successes in this situation. 3 3 C onan and Bêlit are in the same area as three enemies and one of the Heroes attempts to pick the lock on the chest, two successes are ignored (the other Hero is keeping the enemy units “busy”). 3 3 Hindering Die Rolls When a unit rolls dice for Ranged Attack actions or complex Manipulation actions, the number of successes is reduced by 1 for each enemy unit equal to or greater than the number of friendly units in that area. 18 ","Skills and Encumbrance Heroes and some Overlord units have a number of skills. Skills are represented by icons, and their effects are explained on the skill game aids and detailed at the end of this rulebook. The icon to the left of a Hero’s skills indicates the Hero’s maximum Encumbrance value. If a Hero’s Encumbrance level ever exceeds the Hero’s maximum Encumbrance value, the Hero must immediately drop one or more objects to reduce their Encumbrance level to equal to or less than their maximum Encumbrance value. The red number in the lower-right corner of each skill icon indicates the skill’s Encumbrance limit. The total of the Encumbrance values of all of a Hero’s objects is the Hero’s Encumbrance level. If the Hero’s Encumbrance level is equal to or higher than a skill’s Encumbrance limit, the skill cannot be used. Encumbrance can also affect a Hero’s movement. The Encumbrance chart is the movement icon to the right of a Hero’s skills with two Encumbrance limits. During the Action phase, if the Hero’s Encumbrance value is equal to or higher than either Encumbrance limit, the Hero receives fewer movement points from their movement value based on the highest exceeded limit (as indicated under the limit). 6 6 6 6 9 9 - 1 - 2 12 12 3 Chain mail Chain mail S hevatas has the Evasive skill, which allows him to cross areas that contain enemy units without suffering any movement penalties. However, once his Encumbrance level reaches 5, the Evasive skill no longer applies. So, if he is already holding a Kris (Encumbrance 1) and a Crossbow (Encumbrance 3) when he finds a suit of Chain Mail (Encumbrance 3) inside a chest, the decision of whether to put on the Chain Mail becomes a real dilemma… 5 5 1 + + Kris Kris 3 + Crossbow Crossbow + + < - One-handed and Two-handed Weapons A weapon that has an Encumbrance value of 2 or less is considered a one-handed weapon. A weapon that has an Encumbrance value of 3 or more is considered a two-handed weapon; a Hero with such a weapon cannot use another weapon for a single attack. 19 ","Game Turn Example H adrathus, Shevatas, and Conan have infiltrated a Pict camp in search of a princess they know to be held captive in one of the huts. The Overlord has just completed their turn, so it is now the Heroes’ turn. Conan and Shevatas are both in the same area and still relatively fresh, so they choose to be Aggressive this turn; they each move two gems from their Fatigue zones to their Reserve zones. Hadrathus, exhausted from casting two spells, chooses the Cautious stance; he moves five gems from his Fatigue zone to his Reserve zone. Conan takes the lead to enter the hut nearest to him. This costs him 2 movement points: 1 for crossing the area’s border + 1 for the flap at the hut’s entrance, which are covered by his base movement value. Inside, he encounters three Picts and a chest, but no princess. Conan swings his axe in a Circular Strike, decapitating all three of his enemies (He assigns four gems to his Melee Attack space and adds his Battle Axe’s Melee Attack bonus, which allows him to roll five red dice total and reroll one for free). 5 5 2 4 4 20 ","The chest now stands before him unguarded, however he decides to wait and allow Shevatas to act in the hope of using his remaining energy more wisely. Shevatas decides to investigate a hut that is three areas away. He assigns one gem to his Move space, using the Move action to gain 1 movement point, in addition to his 3 base movement points he gained at the start of the phase to enter the hut (1 point per area plus 1 point for the hut’s flap). The hut contains no Picts, but it does house the unconscious princess and a chest. After a short discussion, the Heroes decide it would be best for Conan to carry the princess, as the princess’ Encumbrance value of 6 would deny Shevatas the use of his Evasive and Untouchable skills. Conan disregards the nearby chest and instead performs a Move action to gain 2 movement points, enough to cross the flap and exit the hut. He decides not to spend any further gems, making sure to save some to Guard against attacks during the Overlord’s turn. He then lets Shevatas act once more... Shevatas decides to perform a Manipulation to try to open the chest in the hut and claim its contents. Opting to save their remaining gems, the players proceed to the End phase, move their assigned gems to their Fatigue zones, and then pass to the Overlord’s turn. 3 3 3 4 4 2 4 4 6 6 5 5 21 ","Falling Damage When a unit (Hero or Overlord miniature) falls, the player controlling that unit rolls dice as instructed by the scenario. Falling damage is unavoidable (Guard action and Armor cannot be used), but Reroll actions can be performed to try to mitigate falling damage. Falling does not cause a unit to lose any remaining base movement points. If a falling unit is carrying another unit, both suffer the same damage but the player controlling the carrying unit is the only one who can perform Reroll actions. Area Attacks indicates that an effect is an area attack. When a unit attacks an area, they attack each unit (Hero and Overlord) in the specified area. The dice for an area attack are rolled once and apply to each attack. The attacker resolves the attacks in the order of their choice. Guard bonuses from Weapon cards cannot be used to defend against area attacks, but dodging, Armor, and Guard bonuses from shields work as usual. Assets with the area attack icon (such as the Explosive Orb) are discarded after use. Overlord´s Book You now know all the rules to play as Heroes. To play a game of Conan, you will also need to read the Overlord’s Book; it contains all the rules needed to play as the Overlord and all the information regarding how to set up scenarios. You will notice that most of the Overlord’s rules are similar to the Heroes’ (Attacks, Move, Hindering, etc.). Occupied Areas A miniature cannot end its movement or move across an area if the miniature’s base could not fit entirely in that area; that area is an occupied area. Occupied areas are considered to be within Melee range of all adjacent areas. However, it is not possible to perform a Melee Attack from an occupied area to an adjacent area. Rerolls Some die icons show an arrow on them (see page 4). Once after a player rolls a die indicated by one of these icons, the player may reroll one die of the matching type for free (without performing a Reroll action). Certain skills (such as Support) allow players to reroll a die for free even if that die has already been rerolled. Activating Allies A Hero with the Leadership skill can give orders to any Ally on the board, when instructed by the scenario. In such cases, place the corresponding Ally tile next to that Hero’s sheet. During the Action phase, if they are in an Aggressive stance, the Hero may activate the Ally units (miniatures) by assigning gems from their Reserve zone to the Ally tile: - Assigning one gem activates one Ally unit. Each Ally unit can only be activated once per Action phase. When an Ally attacks, they lose their remaining points from their base movement value. - The Hero can assign additional gems to gain additional movement points (1 gem = 1 movement point for 1 Ally unit) after they spent their base movement or after they attacked. A Hero cannot gain more movement points than the Ally’s base movement value. - The Aggressive or Cautious Hero can also assign gems to perform a Guard action with an Ally (1 gem = for 1 Ally unit). - The Aggressive or Cautious Hero may assign gems to Reroll an Ally’s dice (1 gem = Reroll 1 die once). Unless specified otherwise, an Ally has only 1 life point. At the end of the Action phase, all the gems on the Ally tile are moved to the Hero’s Fatigue zone. If all the Heroes with the Leadership skill die, the Allies and their tile are immediately removed from the game. 22 ","Crédits Game Designer: Frédéric Henry.
