["This rule set allows you to play through a single solo/coop scenario or a campaign of linked scenarios with no need for an Overlord player. Players choose their Heroes from a vari- ety of Archetypes and progress in terms of equipment and abilities. This rule set does not replace the original game or diminish its spirit and style; it is a separate mode, with its own flavor and motivations. These rules were originally printed in the Conan Monolith Sourcebook (published by Modiphius) and have been slightly revamped for this book. A Different Approach The following rules assume players have a thorough knowl- edge of how to play Monolith’s Conan Board Game. Those rules are not reprinted here, but are referenced herein, so prior experience playing the game is required. Solo/cooperative rules allow players to play through specially designed scenarios that eliminate the role of the Overlord. Instead, the players follow a system of automated commands to control the Overlord’s tiles and miniatures. The players do not need to think or strategize for the Overlord tiles and miniatures; the rules and the scenario will do the strategizing for the Overlord. If a situation ever arises that is not covered by the rules or scenario, the players may choose whichever option is in their own best interest. For the Heroes, the Rules Don’t Change The first thing to understand is that the rules for Heroes are the same as in the original Adventure Mode rules. They move, attack, manipulate, and cast spells as they always have. Their initial setup remains unchanged and is dictated by each scenario. The only difference is strate- gic. It requires a slightly different approach when battling the pre-determined commands of this non-player Overlord than it does against a human opponent. SOLO/COOPERATIVE PLAY RULES “Olmec spoke further of dark and mysterious matters, of black magic and wizardry conjured out of the black night of the catacombs, of weird creatures invoked out of darkness for horrible allies… for it was in the eastern catacombs where lay the bones of the greatest wizards of the ancient Xuchotlans, with their immemorial secrets.” - Red Nails Solo/Cooperative Mode ","9 Overlord Setup In addition to controlling one or more of the Heroes, the player(s) of solo/co-op mode must also serve as hands for the Overlord. This task could be assigned to a single player or be a shared responsibility for those at the table. Fortunately, the process is simple. Each scenario will show you which game boards to use, where to place the minia- tures during setup, and which Overlord tiles to place in the River on the Book of Skelos. Once these components are in place, locate the required double-sided tokens from the board game box. It is important that you have one for each corresponding tile in the River. In most cases, you will require numbers 1 through 6, but this depends on the scenario. Remember to use the tokens that have the same grayish star-like design on the backside to ensure you will not know which Overlord tile is next to activate (see below). Once you have these tokens, place them numbered side down in the Reserve zone of the Book of Skelos where the Overlord normally places their gems to create the Activation token pool. (In this game mode, the Overlord does not use gems.) Note, however, that some scenarios have their own rules for Overlord activations; this is just the default method. Determining Overlord Activations The Overlord has a series of automatic commands, and it is up to the players to follow the scenario instructions, move the Overlord’s miniatures, and roll the dice for attacks against their own Heroes. Before we outline these commands, we must know in what order, by what process, and how often the Overlord activates their tiles. Each turn, the Overlord activates a number of tiles equal to the number of Heroes on the board. If at any time one of the Heroes is killed, the Overlord loses one activation (see Number of Overlord Activations below). To activate a tile: 1. One of the players randomly picks up an Activation token and flips it over to reveal the number. 2. Temporarily place this numbered token in the top left slot of the Book of Skelos Benefits token slots (normally reserved for the Movement Benefit token). This number will correspond to one of the numbers on the River. 3. Whichever tile corresponds to this number will immedi- ately activate (See Overlord Commands/Activating the Overlord Tiles below). The tile remains in its position and is not placed at the end of the River. 4. Once this activation is finished, take any additional activations the Overlord gets (again, this is dictated by the number of Heroes currently on the board or by the scenario’s special rules). Place the second Activation token in the Guard action slot, and the third Activation token in the Reroll action slot. If you’re playing with four Heroes, place the fourth Activation token directly into the Fatigue zone, as that is the maximum number of activations the Overlord will ever get per turn. 5. Once you are done activating tiles, remove all spent tokens from the three Benefit token slots and place them number side facing up in the Fatigue zone on the Book of Skelos. Refreshing the Activation Token Pool If the Overlord has activations available but all of their tokens are in the Fatigue zone, it is time to refresh the Activation token pool. To do this, flip the tokens in the Fatigue zone and the Benefit token slots so the number sides are down, shuf- fle them, and place them in the Reserve zone. In this way, it is possible for a particular tile to activate twice during a single Overlord’s turn. This will increase in frequency as tiles are flipped (see “Dead” Tiles and Corresponding Activation tokens on the next page). Alternatively, you may use a small bowl or pouch to store the tokens in, so they are drawn blindly. Overlord Defense The Overlord does not roll for defense. To damage an Overlord unit, Heroes must simply overcome the unit’s Armor Value (unless the scenario specifies otherwise). THE OVERLORD Number of Overlord Activations If one of the Heroes dies, the Overlord immediately loses one activation. For example, at the beginning of a turn, with three Heroes on the board, the Overlord receives three activations. If a Hero is killed during the Overlord’s second activation, that Hero is immediately removed from the board and the Overlord will not receive their third activation. On the next Overlord’s turn, the Overlord only receives two activations (assuming there are still two Heroes on the board and one didn’t blow themselves up with an Explosive Orb or fall victim to a Counterattack). ","10 Here the Overlord is taking their third activation for the turn. Tiles 4 (Dragon of Xuchotl) and 5 (Thak) have already activated and number 2 has just been drawn randomly from the Activation token pool, meaning the Giant Snake activates. These Activation tokens are drawn one at a time and the tile with the corresponding number is activated. They are placed left to right in the slots normally reserved for Overlord Benefits tokens. This is to remind you which activation you’re on and how many you’ve taken. Once the Overlord has activated a number of times equal to the number of Heroes on the board, move the spent Activation tokens to the Fatigue zone of the Book of Skelos. If you’re playing with 4 Heroes, the 4th token simply goes straight to the Fatigue zone as it is the final possible activation. Once all Activation tokens in the Activation Pool have been spent, Refresh the Activation Pool (see page 9). 3 4 Dragon of Xuchotl Dragon of Xuchotl 3 1 1 1 Xotalanc Hunters Xotalanc Hunters There will be times when a particular tile will be killed and won’t return (via Reinforcements, for example). When you draw an Activation token associated with a tile that has no miniatures left on the board and will not return, flip the tile, remove the Activation token from the Book of Skelos, and draw a replacement Activation token. The flipped (and bloodied) tile stays in the River as a visual indicator that it won’t be bothering you anymore and its token is removed from rotation. However, when you draw an Activation token associated with a tile that has no miniatures left on the board but can be reinforced, that Overlord activation is wasted. If, at any time during a scenario, a unit that can be reinforced loses the ability to be reinforced, follow the rules to remove the Activation token as described in this section. “Dead” Tiles and Corresponding Activation Tokens Activation Token Pool Activation Token Pool Activation Slots Activation Slots 1 1 st st 2 2 nd nd 3 3 rd rd Activation Token Cycle 4 4 th th Activation Slot Activation Slot and Fatigue zone and Fatigue zone ","11 Overlord’s Turn Quick Reference 1. Determine the number of Overlord activations (activations = number of Heroes on the board). 2. Anytime the Reserve zone is empty, return all Activation tokens to the Reserve zone (numbered side facing down). Then, draw an Activation token (as long as the Overlord has more activations available). 3. Activate the tile on the River that corresponds to the number on the Activation token you have just drawn. 4. If the Overlord still has available activations, activate again by drawing another random token from the Activation token pool. Overlord Commands/Activating the Overlord Tiles As a general rule, an Activating Overlord unit will attempt to attack the most vulnerable target, known hence forth as the Target Hero (see Determining the Target Hero below). The unit(s) associated with the activating tile will attempt to attack the Target Hero by moving into the Hero’s area for a Melee Attack, firing a ranged weapon, or moving and firing a ranged weapon. If some of the units in the activating tile can attack the Hero, they will, even if others cannot. Those that cannot will attempt to attack an Alternate Target Hero, if possible (see Determining an Alternate Target Hero) or will simply move as close to the Target Hero as possible. These rules will be detailed below. Once you have read them you are encouraged to consult the Determining Target Hero and Alternate Target Hero Quick Reference Table on page 12. Determining the Target Hero If possible, all units associated with the activating tile will attack the Target Hero by using a Ranged Attack or Melee Attack action (or any special action such as a spell detailed in the scenario). The Target Hero is the Hero with the fewest energy gems in their Reserve zone. That means, as long as the activating Overlord unit can attack the Target Hero by moving into their area for a Melee Attack, firing a ranged weapon, or by a combination of moving and firing a ranged weapon, they will attack that Hero. If there are two or more Heroes with the same number of energy gems in their Reserve zone and they can be reached by the activating Overlord unit for an attack, whichever of these Heroes has the most gems in their Wounds zone will become the target. If both of these values are equal, the players may choose which Hero will be attacked. Note that most scenarios have special rules indicating which Hero a particular Overlord tile will attack. In some cases it will mean attacking the Hero with the most gems in their Reserve zone (see The Strongest Hero). In these cases, the scenario rules always override these rules. Path of Least Resistance An Activating Overlord unit will always follow the path of least resistance, and a route that would not risk damage to the unit, to make its attack. Sometimes this means not moving at all (if they share the area with the Target Hero), and sometimes this means moving a number of areas up to their movement value in order to make an attack (either a Melee Attack or Ranged Attack action). Hindering conditions and paths that could cause damage should be taken into account when determining the path of least resistance. Cunning Attackers In this game mode, when an Overlord tile associated with multiple units activates, each of these units will move, resolve their attacks, and then the next unit associated with the tile will activate. This is different than the regular rules where Overlord units must move before attacking or lose all unspent movement points. Players choose the order in which these units activate. Hindering and Ranged Attacks Once line of sight is determined against the Target Hero, but before making a Ranged Attack that would be affected by hindering, the activating Overlord unit will first attempt to move to avoid the penalty. In most cases, particular skills make this movement easy (Evasive) or entirely unnecessary (Elite Shooter). If the activating Overlord unit using the Ranged Attack is unable to avoid or ignore the penalties caused by hindering, or they would lose line of sight by moving, they will still attack the Target Hero and receive the penalty. Hindering and Melee Attacks If, while on its way to make a Melee Attack against a Target Hero, an activating Overlord unit would encounter hindering conditions, it will only make the move if it can actually reach the Target Hero’s area in the same move. Otherwise, it will select an Alternate Target Hero (see Determining an Alternate Target Hero) that it can reach for an attack as part of this activation. If it can’t reach an Alternate Target 3 4 Dragon of Xuchotl Dragon of Xuchotl 3 4 Dragon of Xuchotl Dragon of Xuchotl Avoiding Hindering with Ranged Attacks: Let’s say Kerim Shah occupies the same area as two Heroes, but neither of these two is the Target Hero. If Kerim Shah had line of sight to the Target Hero, and he is several areas away, Kerim Shah will try to avoid any hindering penalties before making the Ranged Attack. Because Kerim Shah does not have either the Elite Shooter or Concentration skill, he would need to move to another area (not occupied by Heroes) where he still has line of sight, to avoid the hindering penalty. If Kerim Shah had the Evasive skill, he would not suffer a penalty for leaving this area, but since he does not, he will need to rely on his base movement value of 2. Because the two Heroes would effectively reduce Kerim Shah’s movement by two, he would be unable to leave the area. Though there is no way Kerim Shah can avoid the hindering penalty, he will still attack the Target Hero. ","12 Hero for an attack, it will simply move as close to the Target Hero as possible. Since units resolve their activations sequentially, hindering conditions should be reevaluated after each unit’s activation. Tiles with Units in Different Areas It should be noted that not all units associated with a single tile will necessarily occupy the same area when they activate. With that in mind, it may mean that some of the units will move to attack the Target Hero, while others will make their way closer to the Target Hero, or, if it’s within their capabilities, will select an Alternate Target Hero instead (again, see Determining an Alternate Hero). The Strongest Hero In many scenarios, there is a rule stating that a particular tile or tiles will attack the “strongest” Hero. In this case, follow these guidelines to determine the Target Hero: 1. First, check which Hero has the most energy gems in their Reserve zone. That Hero becomes the Target Hero. 2. If two Heroes have the same amount of gems in their Reserve zone, the Target Hero will be the Hero who has suffered fewer damage. 3. If both of these amounts are equal, the players choose which of these Heroes is the Target Hero. Determining an Alternate Target Hero The following conditions will prevent an activating Overlord unit from attacking the Target Hero (again, that’s the Hero with the fewest energy gems in their Reserve zone), causing them to determine an Alternate Target Hero. 1. The activating unit cannot reach the Target Hero for a Melee Attack (due to other Heroes hindering this miniature’s movement or simply because it does not have a high enough movement value to reach the Target Hero). 2. The activating unit cannot get a clear line of sight to attack the Target Hero with a Ranged Attack (even after moving up to their movement value). 3. The Target Hero has a power or effect that prevents that Hero from being targeted by an attack. 4. An Event or special rule may dictate that a particular tile will attack a particular Hero. In some cases, it will be the Hero who has the most energy gems in their Reserve zone that will be targeted (see Strongest Hero on page 10). These instances will be detailed in the scenario. If any of these circumstances prevent the activating Overlord unit from attacking the Target Hero, they will attack an Alternate Target Hero. In this case, the Hero they attack will be the Hero who has the second fewest gems in their Reserve zone and who can be reached for a Melee or Ranged Attack (as per the same conditions above). If ever two or more Heroes have the same (fewest in number) energy gems in their Reserve zone, then the activating Overlord unit will attack whichever Hero has more gems in their Wound zone. If all these values are equal, the players may choose which Hero is the target of the attack. If an activating Overlord unit is unable to attack any of the Heroes on the board, they will target the nearest Ally (if applicable). Otherwise, they will move as close as possible to the Target Hero. Rerolls Activating Overlord units that possess the reroll symbol on their attack dice will always reroll a blank result, but will never reroll any other results. They will use all of the reroll options they have, but again, only to reroll any blank results. The Support skill works in addition to and by the same rules as any of these reroll symbols, though players should note that Support works differently for Heroes in this game mode. See Support on page 13. Determining Target Hero/Alternate Target Hero Quick Reference An Activating Overlord Unit must determine a Target Hero • Check which Hero has the fewest energy gems in their Reserve zone. That Hero becomes the Target Hero. • If two Heroes have the same amount of gems in their Reserve, the Target Hero will be the Hero who has suffered more damage. • If both of these amounts are equal, the players choose which of these Heroes is the Target Hero. Determining an Alternate Hero • If an activating Overlord unit would be unable to attack the Target Hero for any reason (even after moving), players will determine an Alternate Target Hero. • The Alternate Target Hero is the Hero that has the second fewest gems in its Reserve zone and can be reached for an attack. If two or more Heroes (that can be reached for an attack) have the same amount of gems in their reserve, the Alternate Target Hero will be the Hero who has suffered more damage. If these amounts are equal, the players choose which of these Heroes is the Target Hero. • If an activating Overlord unit is unable to attack any of the Heroes on the board, they will target the nearest Ally (players choose which Ally). On the ultra-rare occasion that players are unable to determine which Hero should be attacked by an Overlord unit, players choose any Hero within reach (for Melee or Ranged Attack action) as the target of the attack. Reminder An activating Overlord unit will always first try to attack the Target Hero. Even if the activating Overlord unit is in the same area as another Hero, it will still break away to attack the Target Hero, if it can reach them during the same activation. ","3 Rules & Clarifications Oversized Units Oversized Unit Skills If a scenario stipulates a unit is Oversized, that tile gains the Reach and Evasive skills in addition to whatever skills are printed on their tile. Units are only considered Oversized if the scenario says so. Large Miniatures Large miniatures present some challenges when fitting into areas. Units with exceptionally large bases may pass through smaller areas, but they can only remain in an area in which they fit. Minor overlaps of base rims, jutting miniature features, and cosmetic area features should not prevent miniatures from fitting in an area. Players may want to discuss any potentially ambiguous areas and agree on resolutions before beginning play. Reminder about Large Miniatures Just because a miniature is large in size does not mean it is considered an Oversized unit for gameplay purposes. A unit may be considered Oversized in one scenario and not Oversized in another."]
