["","3 Rules & Clarifications Oversized Units Oversized Unit Skills If a scenario stipulates a unit is Oversized, that tile gains the Reach and Evasive skills in addition to whatever skills are printed on their tile. Units are only considered Oversized if the scenario says so. Large Miniatures Large miniatures present some challenges when fitting into areas. Units with exceptionally large bases may pass through smaller areas, but they can only remain in an area in which they fit. Minor overlaps of base rims, jutting miniature features, and cosmetic area features should not prevent miniatures from fitting in an area. Players may want to discuss any potentially ambiguous areas and agree on resolutions before beginning play. Reminder about Large Miniatures Just because a miniature is large in size does not mean it is considered an Oversized unit for gameplay purposes. A unit may be considered Oversized in one scenario and not Oversized in another. Translation Errors Mind Control: The English version of this spell indicates the target must not be in the caster’s line of sight. This was a translation error. Line of sight does not affect whom the caster can target with this spell. Flying: For this book, flying allows a character to fly over the elements of the scenery. Flight ignores the movement constraints and penalties of the terrain, and is not affected by hindering. Frequently Asked Questions Round What is a Round? One complete cycle of a Heroes’ turn followed by an Overlords’ turn. Reach Does Reach require the adjacent unit to be on the same level, or can they be different levels (i.e. ship and water, inn balcony and floor, fortress wall and interior, etc.)? Reach requires units be on the same level. Connecting areas like stairs or the Fortress rock slides are considered to be at both the higher and lower levels and therefore Reach will work if attacking to or from one of these areas. Attacking a unit at a different level, however, requires a Ranged Attack or Spell. Elevation Bonus Do spells that allow you to cause damage at range incur an elevation bonus when used from an elevated area? No, the elevation bonus only applies to the Ranged Attack action. Does Reach incur an elevation bonus for Melee attacks? No. The only time Reach incurs an elevation bonus is if the special rules are used for the Inn game board. Constriction If a unit has Constriction and Reach, Constriction can possibly move the target from one area to another. In this instance, does the damage from the attack happen before or after the unit is pulled into the attacker’s area? (This can affect skills like Bodyguard, Support, etc.) The movement from Constriction happens first. Thus, an Allied unit with Bodyguard or Support would already need to be in the attacker’s area for the skill’s effects to apply. Web Projection What happens if a unit doesn’t have enough movement points to escape because they have been poisoned? Are they immobile for the rest of the game? No, if a Hero does not have the potential to spend the 4 required movement points to escape, they may escape by spending all of their free movement points and all points up to their exertion limit. In Adventure Mode, if an Overlord tile is caught in a web (by use of the Net item), the Overlord may use the unit’s free movement points and gems to reach the 4 points to escape, even if the unit would not normally be able to reach 4 movement points. In Solo/Coop Mode, the Overlord tile simply uses all free movement points to escape. Fascination Can you perform Mind Control on someone with Fascination? A unit cannot target an enemy unit with Fascination for any reason until they attack the unit. Can characters with Fascination be damaged with area attacks? Yes, unless the scenario dictates otherwise. Concentration Does Concentration work to ignore hindering if you’re only performing a simple Manipulation? Simple Manipulations are not affected by hindering because there are no dice rolls required. Mitra’s Healing Can casters use Mitra’s Healing on themselves? Yes. Anchor: If someone with Precision Strike uses the Anchor (which grants Circular Strike) and kills the first target, does Precision Strike go into effect for subsequent targets? No. The player must choose if they are making a Precision Strike or a Circular Strike before they roll. Activating Allies How many movement points can an Ally have during an activation? When the Ally is activated, they receive free movement points based on the value printed on their tile. When the Ally has used these movement points or attacked, the Hero who activated the Ally may spend additional gems up to the value printed on the tile to receive one movement point per gem. Guard What types of attacks can a Hero Parry? Melee Attacks - A Hero can use a shield or a weapon with a Guard bonus to Parry, but not both. Ranged Attacks - A Hero can use a shield to Parry. Spells - A Hero can use a shield to Parry. Area Attacks - A Hero can use a shield to Parry. If a Hero does not have, or cannot use, equipment with the Guard bonus to defend, when they use gems to defend against an attack it is considered a Dodge. ","This rule set allows you to play through a single Solo/coop scenario or a campaign of linked scenarios with no need for an Overlord player. Players choose their Heroes from a vari-ety of Archetypes and progress in terms of equipment and abilities. This rule set does not replace the original game or diminish its spirit and style; it is a separate mode, with its own flavour and motivations. These rules were originally printed in the Conan Monolith Sourcebook (published by Modiphius) and have been slightly revamped for this book. A Different Approach The following rules assume players have a thorough knowl-edge of how to play Monolith’s Conan Board Game. Those rules are not reprinted here, but are referenced herein, so prior experience playing the game is required. Solo/cooperative rules allow players to play through specially designed scenarios that eliminate the role of the Overlord. Instead, the players follow a system of automated commands to control the Overlord’s tiles and miniatures. The players do not need to think or strategize for the Overlord tiles and miniatures; the rules and the scenario will do the strategizing for the Overlord. If a situation ever arises that is not covered by the rules or scenario, the players may chose whichever option is in their own best interest. For the Heroes, the Rules Don’t Change The first thing to understand is that the rules for Heroes are the same as in the original Adventure Mode rules. They move, attack, manipulate, and cast spells as they always have. Their initial setup remains unchanged and is dictated by each scenario. The only difference is strategic. It requires a slightly different approach when battling the pre-deter-mined commands of this non-player Overlord than it does against a human opponent. SOLO/COOPERATIVE PLAY RULES The players do not need to think or strategize for the Overlord tiles and miniatures; the rules and the scenario will do the strategizing for the Overlord. If a situation ever arises that is not covered by the rules or scenario, the players “Damn peculiar things going on along this coast. But that’s always the way when civilized men come into the wilderness. They’re all crazy as hell.” - “The Black Stranger” Solo/Cooperative Mode ","7 Overlord Setup In addition to controlling one or more of the Heroes, the player(s) of solo/co-op mode must also serve as hands for the Overlord. This task could be assigned to a single player or be a shared responsibility for those at the table. Fortunately, the process is simple. Each scenario will show you which game boards to use, where to place the minia-tures during setup, and which Overlord tiles to place in the River on the Book of Skelos. Once these components are in place, locate the required double-sided tokens from the board game box. It is important that you have one for each corresponding tile in the River. In most cases, you will require numbers 1 through 6, but this depends on the scenario. Remember to use the tokens that have the same grayish star-like design on the backside to ensure you will not know which Overlord tile is next to activate (see below). Once you have these tokens, place them numbered side down in the Reserve zone of the Book of Skelos where the Overlord normally places their gems to create the Activation Token Pool. (In this game mode, the Overlord does not use gems.) Note, however, that some scenarios have their own rules for Overlord activations; this is just the default method. Determining Overlord Activations The Overlord has a series of automatic commands, and it is up to the players to follow the scenario instructions, move the Overlord’s miniatures, and roll the dice for attacks against their own Heroes. Before we outline these commands, we must know in what order, by what process, and how often the Overlord activates their tiles. Each turn, the Overlord activates a number of tiles equal to the number of Heroes on the board. If at any time one of the Heroes is killed, the Overlord loses one activation (see Number of Overlord Activations below). To activate a tile: 1. One of the players randomly picks up an Activation token and flips it over to reveal the number. 2. Temporarily place this numbered token in the top left slot of the Book of Skelos Benefits token slots (normally reserved for the Movement Benefit token). This number will correspond to one of the numbers on the River. 3. Whichever tile corresponds to this number will immedi-ately activate (See Overlord Commands/Activating the Overlord Tiles below). 4. Once this activation is finished, take any additional activations the Overlord gets (again, this is dictated by the number of Heroes currently on the board or by the scenario’s special rules). Place the second Activation token in the Guard action slot, and the third Activation token in the Reroll action slot. If you’re playing with four Heroes, place the fourth Activation token directly into the Fatigue zone, as that is the maximum number of activations the Overlord will ever get per turn. 5. Once you are done activating tiles, remove all spent tokens from the three Benefit token slots and place them number side facing up in the Fatigue zone on the Book of Skelos. Refreshing the Activation Token Pool If the Overlord has activations available but all of their tokens are in the Fatigue zone, it is time to refresh the Activation token pool. To do this, flip the tokens in the Fatigue zone so the number sides are down, shuffle them, and place them in the Reserve zone. In this way, it is possible for a particular tile to activate twice during a single Overlord turn. This will increase in frequency as tiles are flipped (see “Dead” Tiles and Corresponding Activation tokens on the next page). Alternatively, you may use a small bowl or pouch to store the tokens in, so they are drawn blindly. Overlord Defense The Overlord does not roll for defense. To damage an Overlord unit, Heroes must simply overcome the unit’s Armor Value (unless the scenario specifies otherwise). THE OVERLORD Number of Overlord Activations If one of the Heroes dies, the Overlord immediately loses one activation. For example, at the beginning of a turn, with three Heroes on the board, the Overlord receives three activations. If a Hero is killed during the Overlord’s second activation, that Hero is immediately removed from the board and the Overlord will not receive their third activation. On the next Overlord turn, the Overlord only receives two activations (assuming there are still two Heroes on the board and one didn’t blow themselves up with an Explosive Orb or fall victim to a Counterattack). ","8 Here you can see the player is the process of taking their third Overlord activation for the turn. Tiles 4 (Khitan Acolytes) and 5 (Thak) have already activated this turn and number 2 has just been drawn randomly from the Activation Token Pool, meaning the Giant Snake gets to activate. As the rules describe above, these Activation tokens are drawn one at a time and the tile with the corresponding number is activated. These tokens are placed left to right in the slots normally reserved for Overlord Benefits tokens. In this way, you are reminded which activation you’re on and how many you’ve taken. Once the Overlord has activated a number of times equal to the number of Heroes on the board, they will move the spent Activation tokens to the Fatigue zone of the Book of Skelos. If you’re playing with 4 Heroes, the 4th token simply goes straight to the Fatigue zone as it is the final possible activation. Once all Activation tokens in the Reserve zone (Activation Pool) have been spent, you will Refresh the Activation Pool (see Refreshing the Activation Token Pool on page 7). Just like in the regular Conan rules, there will be times when a particular tile will be killed and won’t return (via Reinforcements, for example). When you draw an Activation token associated with a tile that has no miniatures left on the board and will not return, flip the tile, remove the Activation token from the Book of Skelos, and draw a replacement Activation token from the Reserve zone. In this way, the flipped (and bloodied tile) stays in the River as a visual indicator that it won’t be bothering you anymore and its token is removed from rotation. “Dead” Tiles and Corresponding Activation Tokens Activation Token Pool Activation Token Pool Activation Slots 1 1 st st 2 2 nd nd 3 3 rd rd Activation Token Cycle 4 4 th th Activation Slot Activation Slot and Fatigue zone and Fatigue zone ","9 Overlord Turn Quick Reference 1. Determine the number of Overlord activations (activations = number of Heroes on the board). 2. Anytime the Reserve zone is empty, return all Activation tokens to the Reserve zone (numbered side facing down). Then, draw an Activation token (as long as the Overlord has more activations available). 3. Activate the tile on the River that corresponds to the number on the Activation token you have just drawn. 4. If the Overlord still has available activations, activate again by drawing another random token from the Activation Token Pool. Overlord Commands/Activating the Overlord Tiles As a general rule, an Activating Overlord Miniature will attempt to attack the most vulnerable target, known hence forth as the Target Hero (see Determining the Target Hero below). The miniature(s) associated with the activating tile will attempt to attack the Target Hero by moving into the Hero’s area for a Melee Attack, firing a ranged weapon, or moving and firing a ranged weapon. If some of the minia-tures in the activating unit can attack the Hero, they will, even if others cannot. Those that cannot will attempt to attack an Alternate Target Hero, if possible (see Determining an Alternate Target Hero) or will simply move as close to the Target Hero as possible. These rules will be detailed below. Once you have read them you are encouraged to consult the Determining Target Hero and Alternate Target Hero Quick Reference Table on page 10. Determining the Target Hero If possible, all miniatures associated with the activating tile will attack the Target Hero by using a Ranged Attack or Melee Attack action (or any special action such as a spell detailed in the scenario). The Target Hero is the Hero with the fewest energy gems in their Reserve zone. That means, as long as the activating Overlord miniature can attack the Target Hero by moving into their area for a Melee Attack, firing a ranged weapon, or by a combination of moving and firing a ranged weapon, they will attack that Hero. If there are two or more Heroes with the same number of energy gems in their Reserve zone and they can be reached by the activating Overlord miniature for an attack, whichever of these Heroes has the most gems in their Wounds zone will become the target. If both of these values are equal, the players may choose which Hero will be attacked. Note that most scenarios have special rules indicating which Hero a particular Overlord tile will attack. In some cases it will mean attacking the Hero with the most gems in their Reserve zone (see The Strongest Hero ). In these cases, the scenario rules always override these rules. Path of Least Resistance An Activating Overlord unit will always follow the path of least resistance, and a route that would not risk damage to the unit, to make its attack. Sometimes this means not moving at all (if they share the area with the Target Hero), and sometimes this means moving a number of areas up to their movement value in order to make an attack (either a Melee Attack or Ranged Attack action). Hindering condi-tions and paths that could cause damage should be taken into account when determining the path of least resistance. Cunning Attackers In this game mode, when an Overlord tile associated with multiple units activates, each of these units will move, resolve their attacks, and then the next unit associated with the tile will activate. This is different than the regular rules where Overlord units must move before attacking or lose all unspent movement points. Players choose the order in which these units activate. Hindering and Ranged Attacks Once line of sight is determined against the Target Hero, but before making a Ranged Attack that would be affected by hindering, the activating Overlord unit will first attempt to move to avoid the penalty. In most cases, particular skills make this movement easy (Evasive) or entirely unneces-sary (Elite Shooter). If the activating Overlord unit using the Ranged Attack is unable to avoid or ignore the penal-ties caused by hindering, or they would lose line of sight by moving, they will still attack the Target Hero and receive the penalty. Hindering and Melee Attacks If, while on its way to make a melee attack against a Target Hero, an activating Overlord unit would encounter hinder-ing conditions, it will only make the move if it can actually reach the Target Hero’s area in the same move. Otherwise, it will select an Alternate Target Hero (see Determining an Alternate Target Hero) that it can reach for an attack as part of this activation. If it can’t reach an Alternate Target Hero for an attack, it will simply move as close to the Target Hero as possible. Since miniatures resolve their activations sequentially, Hindering conditions should be reevaluated after each unit’s activation. Tiles with Units in Different Areas It should be noted that not all units associated with a single tile will necessarily occupy the same area when they acti-vate. With that in mind, it may mean that some of the units will move to attack the Target Hero, while others will make their way closer to the Target Hero, or, if it’s within their capabilities, will select an Alternate Target Hero instead (again, see Determining an Alternate Hero). The Strongest Hero In many scenarios, there is a rule stating that a particu-lar tile or tiles will attack the “strongest” Hero. In this case, follow these guidelines to determine the Target Hero: 1. First, check which Hero has the most energy gems in their Reserve zone. That Hero becomes the Target Hero. ","10 2. If two Heroes have the same amount of gems in their Reserve zone, the Target Hero will be the Hero who has suffered fewer wounds. 3. If both of these amounts are equal, the players choose which of these Heroes is the Target Hero. Determining an Alternate Target Hero The following conditions will prevent an activating Overlord unit from attacking the Target Hero (again, that’s the Hero with the fewest energy gems in their Reserve zone), causing them to determine an Alternate Target Hero. 1. The activating unit cannot reach the Target Hero for a Melee Attack (due to other Heroes hindering this minia-ture’s movement or simply because it does not have a high enough movement value to reach the Target Hero). 2. The activating unit cannot get a clear line of sight to attack the Target Hero with a Ranged Attack (even after moving up to their movement value). 3. The Target Hero has a power or effect that prevents that Hero from being targeted by an attack. 4. An Event or special rule may dictate that a particular tile will attack a particular Hero. In some cases, it will be the Hero who has the most energy gems in their Reserve zone that will be targeted (see Strongest Hero on page 9). These instances will be detailed in the scenario. If any of these circumstances prevent the activating Overlord unit from attacking the Target Hero, they will attack an Alternate Target Hero. In this case, the Hero they attack will be the Hero who has the second fewest gems in their Reserve zone and who can be reached for a Melee or Ranged Attack (as per the same conditions above). If ever two or more Heroes have the same (fewest in number) energy gems in their Reserve zone, then the activating Overlord unit will attack whichever Hero has more gems in their Wound zone. If all these values are equal, the players may choose which Hero is the target of the attack. If an activating Overlord unit is unable to attack any of the Heroes on the board, they will target the nearest Ally (if appli-cable). Otherwise, they will move as close as possible to the Target Hero. Rerolls Activating Overlord units that possess the reroll symbol on their attack dice Activating Overlord units that possess the reroll symbol on Activating Overlord units that possess the reroll symbol on Activating Overlord units that possess the reroll symbol on will always reroll a blank result, but will never reroll any other results. They will use all of the reroll options they have, but again, only to reroll any blank results. The Support skill works in addition to and by the same rules as any of these reroll symbols, though players should note that Support works differently for Heroes in this game mode. See Support on page 11. Determining Target Hero/Alternate Target Hero Quick Reference An Activating Overlord Unit must determine a Target Hero &#149; First, check which Hero has the fewest energy gems in their Reserve zone. That Hero becomes the Target Hero. &#149; If two Heroes have the same amount of gems in their Reserve, the Target Hero will be the Hero who has suffered more wounds. &#149; If both of these amounts are equal, the players choose which of these Heroes is the Target Hero. Determining an Alternate Hero &#149; If an activating Overlord unit would be unable to attack the Target Hero for any reason (even after moving), players will determine an Alternate Target Hero. &#149; The Alternate Target Hero is the Hero that has the second fewest gems in its Reserve zone and can be reached for an attack. If two or more Heroes (that can be reached for an attack) have the same amount of gems in their reserve, the Alternate Target Hero will be the Hero who has suffered more wounds. If these amounts are equal, the players choose which of these Heroes is the Target Hero. &#149; If an activating Overlord unit is unable to attack any of the Heroes on the board, they will target the nearest Ally (players choose which Ally). On the ultra-rare occasion that players are unable to determine which Hero should be attacked by an Overlord unit, players choose any Hero within reach (for Melee or Ranged Attack Action) as the target of the attack. Avoiding Hindering with Ranged Attacks: Let’s say Xaltotun occupies the same area as two Heroes, but neither of these two is the Target Hero. If Xaltotun had line of sight to the Target Hero, and he is several areas away, Xaltotun will try to avoid any hindering penalties before making the Ranged Attack. Because Xaltotun does not have either the Elite Shoot-er or Concentration skill, he would need to move to an-other area (not occupied by Heroes) where he still has line of sight, to avoid the hindering penalty. If Xaltotun had the Evasive skill, he would not suffer a penalty for leaving this area, but since he does not, he will need to rely on his base movement value of 2. Because the two Heroes would effectively reduce Xaltotun’s movement by two, he would be unable to leave the area. Though there is no way Xaltotun can avoid the hindering pen-alty, he will still attack the Target Hero. Reminder An activating Overlord unit will always first try to attack the Target Hero. Even if the activating Overlord unit is in the same area as another Hero, it will still break away to attack the Target Hero, if it can reach him during the same activation. ","11 Solo/Co-op Scenarios We believe these scenarios are best played as a campaign, where equipment, Victory Points, Boons and story all contrib-ute to the sense of progression. However, these scenar-ios can also be played independently of the campaign in Non-campaign Mode. The Options section of each scenario provides the equipment and spells you should use for your Hero Archetypes in Non-campaign Mode. Skills Sacrifice, Bodyguard, Spell Caster, Fascination: Overlord units only use these skills if the scenario outlines how they are to be used. Indeed, some scenarios provide rules for how an Overlord unit must cast a spell. Wall Wrecker, Swimming, Intangible, Leap, Flying: Overlord units only use these skills when it allows them to reach the Target Hero more easily. If using this Skill allows them to avoid any movement or attack restrictions imposed by non-Target Heroes, or gets them to the Target Hero’s area (or an area from which they can attack the Target Hero), they will use this skill. Otherwise, they will simply move to the Target Hero’s area for a Melee Attack or to the closest square from where they can make a Ranged Attack. Climb, Leap: Overlord units only use these skills if the scenario gives rules for doing so. Poison: Unless a scenario defines Poison’s effects, use these rules: When a unit with Poison attacks a Hero, instead of suffering damage, the Hero must place a number of Poison tokens of suffering damage, the Hero must place a number of equal to the amount of damage either on the Melee Attack space or the Move space of their Hero sheet. Each Poison token the Melee Attack space or the Move space of their Hero on an action space reduces by 1 the exertion limit of that action. When both exertion limits are reduced to zero, that Hero immediately dies. If additional Poison tokens are needed, you can use any other token to represent them. Web: Overlord units will use this skill whenever possible, unless the unit is affected by hindering. Support: For Overlord units, this skill works the same as the reroll rules for solo/co-op play and works in addition to any reroll symbols on the tile’s attack value(s). For the Heroes, it works the same as in the V2.0 rules. Counterattack: For Overlord units, this Skill works the same as the traditional rules. For Heroes who possess this skill, they may only use it once per Overlord turn. Blocking: For Overlord units, this skill works as normal. For balancing purposes, a Hero who possesses this skill may not use it in this game mode. Protected: For Overlord units, this skill works as normal. For balancing purposes, a Hero who possesses this skill may not use it in this game mode. Jinx: For Overlord units, this skill works as normal. Heroes who possess this skill may use it normally, but it may create a significant advantage. Use it at the players’ discretion. Command: Heroes who possess this skill may use it normally. Note: Overlord units do not target allies unless they cannot reach a Hero for a Melee or Ranged Attack. Optional Scenarios Scenarios from the Hidden Chambers and Shadow Kingdom expansions are included in this campaign. These scenarios are optional, and included here for completion. Although they are not required for this campaign, they provide an additional challenge and additional rewards. Optional scenarios are indicated by .5 behind their campaign number. Campaign Rules The scenarios provided in this chapter are meant to be played as part of a campaign where the players will accumulate Equipment, Spells, Victory Points, and other progressive elements. Whether players intend to play through the campaign mode or not, we recommend players first try scenario 1: Bay of Death Part 1. This was designed with simplicity in mind, so that players can easily learn the system without being overwhelmed. For those who play in Campaign Mode, it is highly recom-mended that players keep a tally of the equipment, Boons and Victory Points acquired. These concepts are detailed below. Equipment and Cache Each scenario provides the opportunity for the Heroes to attain better equipment. Equipment is cumulative. Once acquired, Heroes have access to it for the remainder of the campaign. There are a few limitations and exceptions, however. Starting a Scenario Before playing a scenario, each Hero chooses equipment from their Cache to use (see below). Players are encour-aged to read ahead about the scenario so they may choose their equipment accordingly. Equipment is not tied to any one Hero and players may trade amongst themselves in-be-tween scenarios or during scenarios, if they want to drop or pass items as per the normal rules. Cache The cache is a pool of all the equipment gathered over the course of the campaign. If you drop or throw an item and don’t recover it during a scenario, and you lose that scenario, you lose the piece of equipment. If you win the scenario, add it, and all equipment acquired during the scenario, to your Cache. Some scenarios have stipulations on adding items to your Cache if you lose the scenario. If players wish to play a scenario in Non-campaign Mode, their cache is listed in the Options section of the scenario. Starting Equipment Starting equipment is assigned to each Hero at the begin-ning of the campaign. They have access to this equipment during the first scenario and every scenario beyond that point. Starting equipment is never lost, not even if it is dropped or thrown. This equipment is stored in your Cache and may be shared among other Heroes as players see fit. ","12 Spells Heroes find Spells the same way as other equipment. In Campaign Mode, however, Heroes do not lose their spells, not even after a defeat. When putting together the asset deck for a scenario, place the Spell Book equipment card into the deck. This will ensure that, when face down, it will be indistinguishable from other equipment cards. In many scenarios, one Spell Book will yield more than one spell. Once attained, assign these spells to the Sorcerer Archetype (see Archetypes and Starting Equipment below) so the player always has access to the spells, even if they select a different sorcerer character between scenarios. Boons In addition to accumulating equipment, players accumulate additional bonuses for their efforts. At the end of scenario 5, each player may choose one Boon to assign to their Hero’s Archetype. These Boons are permanently attached to the Archetype, which allows players the option to change Heroes for new scenarios and never lose their progress. This way the Boon is never lost. Hero Selection With this campaign, we wanted to give players plenty of options as far as which Heroes they could choose. This, however, is a tricky balancing act. Particular skills and stats have the potential to “break the game.” With that in mind, we compiled a list of Heroes players may choose from and grouped them into three Archetypes: Warriors, Rogues, and Sorcerers. Note that some of the Heroes’ Skills will be less potent or potentially useless (see Skills above). Each scenario has been written for 1-3 players to assume control of one Hero from each of the Archetype groups. Players may either play as the same Hero from one scenario to the next, trade who plays which Hero, or select an entirely new one from the archetype options. Adding a Fourth Player To play with four Heroes, add a Hero from the Sellsword Archetype (see below) and increase the starting number of Overlord activations from 3 to 4. Be sure to follow the rules for adding a fourth player in the Options section of each scenario. Archetypes and Starting Equipment For a standard 3 player game, decide which player will control each of the three archetypes. Warrior Warriors are your heavy hitters, such as Conan and Gorm. These characters will be expected to deal death during every scenario. The options for Warriors are: Achilles, Afari, Amra the Lion, Baal-Pteor, Conan, Conan the General, Conan the Mercenary, Conan the Pirate, Conan the Thief, Conan the Wanderer, Conan the Warlord, Constantius, Heracles, Gorm, King Conan, King Kull, Olgerd Vladislav, Othryades, Pallantides, Shentu, Valeria the Warrior. The following Heroes are considered warriors, but are not recommended for thematic reasons or due to their potential to affect balance: Conan the Conqueror, Nameless Horror, Thak, Vanir Valkyrie, Winged One, Yogah of Yag, Zaporavo. Starting equipment: Sword Rogue Rogues rely on their dexterity and mobility in addition to their martial prowess. They can be very useful for securing objectives and/or acquiring equipment from chests. The options for Rogue Heroes are: Amboola, Atalanta, Balthus, Belit, Belit the Princess, Brule, Ghayoor, Ikhmet, N’Gora, Niord, Octavia, Savage Belit, Shevatas, Taurus, Zenobia. Starting equipment: Dagger and Throwing Knives Sorcerer Sorcerers are adept at casting spells. These spells provide aid to other Heroes, make themselves more difficult to hit, and/or allow them to deal their own share of damage. The Options for Sorcerer Heroes are: Hadrathus, N’Yaga, Pelias, Shubba, Skuthus, Taramis, Xaltotun, Zelata. The following Heroes should be considered Sorcerers, but are not recommended for thematic reasons or due to their potential to affect balance: Yogah of Yag, Zogar Sag. Starting equipment: Dagger, Set’s Halo, Ymir’s Retribution Sellsword (Fourth player option) Sellswords can fill many roles. Some are more adept at combat, while others play a supporting role. We recommend the following options for the most balanced experience: Amboola, Belit, Belit (Queen of the Black Coast), Constantius, Ikhmet, Kerim Shah, Leonidas, N’Gora, Odysseus, Shafiah, Valeria. Starting equipment: Choose one of the following sets. A. Tribal Mace & Shield B. Ornamental Spear & Javelin ","13 Victory Points Betrayal of the Infernal Shaman Thus begins Betrayal Betrayal Of the Infernal Shaman Defeat Heroes “killed” during a scenario are unconscious rather than dead. They will rise to fight another day in subse-quent scenarios. But that doesn’t mean there are no conse-quences for losing a scenario. If all Heroes are unconscious during a scenario, the Heroes suffer a Defeat and face the consequences. First, they lose one victory point from their pool (see Victory Points and Rank below). Additionally, they might not gain any or all the equipment available in the scenario (see individual scenario descriptions). Some scenarios include a few thematic punishments as well. All of these are detailed at the end of scenario descriptions. Victory Points and Rank To add an additional challenge to the already challenging scenarios, players may wish to run a tally of their accom-plishments. At the end of each scenario, players will acquire victory points based on how well they did in the scenario. Each scenario details the victory conditions, but in general one victory point is awarded for each Hero that did not die during the scenario. Some scenarios will offer the players a chance to collect extra victory points. If Players suffer a Defeat, they lose one victory point from their pool (and gain zero, obviously). If they haven’t collected any victory points when they suffer a defeat, their victory point tally drops to negative 1. Rank At the end of the campaign, players should add up all the victory points they received during the campaign and compare their earnings to the chart below. Victory Points and the Fourth Player Option If you have decided to play one or more of the scenarios using the fourth player option, ignore the fourth player when calculating victory points. For example, if during a four player game, all four Heroes survive, they will only acquire 3 victory points. Total Rank Description Up to 8 Weakling Only Mitra knows how you managed to survive. None shall remember your name. 9 - 12 Sea Dog You’ve felt the sharp sting of defeat, but also the hot blood of your enemies. Perhaps someday you will win a battle worthy of remembrance, but it is not this day. 13 - 15 Captain You are feared and respected in the streets of Tortage.
