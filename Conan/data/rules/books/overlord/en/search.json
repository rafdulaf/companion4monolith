["1 The Overlord’s Book V2.0 ","2 The King version of the core box is the one that was available during the Kickstarter campaign. The Book of Skelos 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Important: It is strongly advised to read the Heroes Book before this one. Overview This book is intended to explain the game rules for the Over-lord. In Conan, the Overlord is a full-fledged role that allows a player to strategically deploy destructive hordes, powerful nec-romancers, and monstrous beasts to achieve their own goals. Heroes seek to forge their legend; The Overlord is here to destroy it! Unlike the heroes who each have a sheet that allows them to control a character, the Overlord has a dashboard in front of them called the Book of Skelos, which allows them to control a multitude of characters through a simple tactical game system. The Overlord’s troops are represented by tiles that group models whose attributes are identical and act simultaneously such as a band of Pictish Warriors or a crew of Pirates. Sometimes a tile represents a single central character from the scenario, like the terrible sorcerer Zogar Sag or the ruthless Captain Zaporavo. This is the dashboard used by the Overlord to control their units. 1 Benefits Tokens x3: They are placed in the Book of Skelos’ top three slots and allow the Overlord to temporarily increase their units’ movement, or to perform Guard or Reroll actions (See page 8). 2 Overlords Reserve Zone Tile x1: It is placed in the Book of Skelos’ main left slot and represents the Overlord’s Reserve Zone. The red gems placed in this zone represent the Overlord’s available energy and their ability to act. 3 Overlords Fatigue Zone Tile x1: It is placed in the Book of Skelos’ main right slot and represents the Overlord’s Fatigue zone. This is where the Overlord places the red gems they already used to perform actions. 4 Recovery Value Tiles x2: Depending on the scenario, one of the two Recovery Value tiles is placed between the Reserve and Fatigue zones, and indicates the number of gems that the Overlord moves from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone during their Recovery phase (See page 4). 5 Activation Cost Tokens x8: They are placed in the designated slots on the Book of Skelos, from left to right in ascending order. They represent the activation cost of the Overlord’s tiles in the River (See page 5). 6 River: The Overlord sets up their tiles in the River in the order specified by the scenario. 7 Overlords Tiles x45 (Barbarian) / x62 (King *): Each tile represents a model or a group of models that have the same attributes, or events that the Overlord can activate. The Overlord may activate tiles from the River to take control of its models or use the events (See page 4). ","3 Tiles Unit Tiles All unit tiles contain the following: Name Illustration (matching the unit’s model) Base color. Units with the same name are differentiated by different colored bases. A unit tile with a gray outline means that no base is used for that unit. Base Movement Value Armor Value Melee Attack or Ranged Attack Value Skill(s) Reinforcement Cost 1 2 3 4 5 1 7 2 3 4 6 5 8 6 7 8 The Overlord’s tiles fall into two categories: unit tiles and event tiles. At the start of each game, units and events are placed in the River, in the order specified by the scenario. Most scenarios use at least one event tile: When the event tile is activated, the Overlord must perform one of the events described by the scenario. In some scenarios, the event tile is used to resolve more than one event each time the event tile is activated. The number of events, their descriptions, and the conditions for using them are specified by the scenario. Event Tiles Turn Structure In Conan, two sides cross swords: the heroes who play together against the Overlord, sole master of their units. Both sides take turns playing, starting with the side specified by the scenario. Once the heroes’ turn is over, the Overlord takes their turn. On their turn, the Overlord may activate 0, 1 or 2 tiles in the River to move their units and attack the heroes. Each tile represents a model or a group of models that the Overlord takes control of when activating this tile, or events. Once the Overlord has completed their activations, the heroes’ takes their turn. ","4 The Overlord’s Turn The Overlord starts by moving all the gems they spent during the heroes’ turn (on the Guard benefit, reaction spells, etc.) to their Fatigue zone. Then they move a number of energy gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone equal to their recovery value. The Overlord’s recovery value is indicated by the Recovery Value Tile and varies according to the setup of the scenario and the number of heroes facing them at the start of the game. 2. Advance Turn Marker T he Overlord advances the turn marker one space. In this example, the Overlord starts their third round of play. T he Overlord’s Recovery value is 5. During the recovery phase, the Overlord moves 5 gems from the Fatigue Zone (red zone) to the Reserve zone (green zone). At the start of their turn, the Overlord will have 10 gems available to use. 1. Recovery Phase During the Activation phase, the Overlord can activate 0, 1 or 2 tiles in the River. To activate a tile, the Overlord moves a number of gems from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone equal to the tile’s activation cost (indicated by the token above the tile). The Overlord removes the activated tile from the River, slides the remaining tiles to the left, and then places the tile at the end of the River. The Overlord can also activate a dead unit tile (See page 7). 3. Activation phase The Overlord’s turn consists of four phases that take place in the following order: 1. Recovery Phase 2. Advance Turn Marker 3. Activation Phase 4. End Phase ","5 The Overlord moves 3 gems from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue Zone. Then, the Overlord removes the activated tile from the River, slides the remaining tiles to the left, and places the activated tile at the end of the River. If the activated tile is a unit tile, the Overlord activates all units in the group, spending any number of their movement points to move them. Each unit can perform one attack during its activation. When a unit attacks, all units in that group lose their remaining movement points. The Overlord can activate the same tile twice, but they must move gems equal to the tile’s new activation cost the second time. If the activated tile is an event tile, the Overlord resolves events as indicated by the scenario (see Event Tile, page 3). At the end of the turn, the Overlord moves all gems spent during their turn (including those placed on spell cards) to their Fatigue zone. 4. End phase ","6 Hindering (See page 17 of the Heroes’ Book) Movement is affected by hindering. Ranged attacks are affected by hindering. Melee attacks are not affected by hindering. Tile Attributes This value indicates the amount of damage that is automatically absorbed by the unit’s armor each time a unit represented by that unit tile is attacked. Simply subtract the unit’s armor value from the attack power to determine the amount of damage suffered by that unit for each attack against that unit. Armor Value This is the number of free movement points available to each unit represented by the unit tile. These base movement points can be spent only before any unit from the same unit tile attacks. When a unit attacks, all units in that group lose their remaining movement points. Extra movement points can be gained by using the Movement benefit (See Movement, page 8). Base Movement Value This indicates the number and type of dice that each unit represented by the unit tile rolls when performing a melee attack. The results of these dice may be rerolled (see Reroll, page 8), but their number and type cannot be changed. Melee Attack This indicates the number and type of dice that each unit represented by the unit tile rolls when performing a ranged attack. The results of these dice may be rerolled (see Reroll, page 8), but their number and type cannot be changed. Ranged Attack Skills are represented by icons. Their effects are detailed on the skill game aids. Skills I n the center of the village, Conan comes face to face with a guard. The Cimmerian hits him with an axe with an attack power of 5: Since guards only have one life point and the Overlord does not want to spend gems to Guard (see Guard, page 8), the guard dies and his model is removed from the board. The guard has an armor value of 2. 2 The guard suffers 3 damage (5 - 2) which must be subtracted from his life points. 2 -= ","This value indicates the number of reinforcement points that the Overlord must spend to return one model represented by that unit tile to the board. If a unit tile does not have a reinforcement cost, it can-not be reinforced. During the game, the Overlord gains reinforcement points by ac-tivating the event tile. When they do, the Overlord may immedi-ately spend these points to return models to the board. Reinforced models are placed in any of the reinforcement areas, as indicated by reinforcement tokens located on the board. If a reinforcement area is occupied (see page 22 of the Heroes’ Book), the Overlord can choose to place the reinforced models in an adjacent area. If the adjacent area is also occupied, reinforced models cannot be placed in this area. Unless specified otherwise, the Overlord can spend reinforce-ment points only to return models that have been killed during the scenario to the board. If one or more models from a dead unit tile (see above) are re-turned to the board as reinforcement, the unit tile is flipped fa-ceup and remains in its current position in the River. Important: Each unit tile corresponds to a group of one or more units. Some tiles correspond to a single character, such as a lieutenant or monster, while other tiles correspond to multiple characters, such as a group of minions. The number of characters that correspond to a unit tile varies from one scenario to another, but can also change during the game, depending on losses and possible reinforcements. By default, and unless specified otherwise in the scenario, the number of characters corresponding to a tile cannot exceed the number indicated at the start of the scenario. A single character may also be represented by more than one unit tile in the River. T hree of the green Pict Hunters were killed earlier in the game. Their models are therefore available for reinforcement. The Overlord thinks that now is a good time to bring them back into play and decides to activate the event tile by moving 7 gems to their Fatigue zone (its position in the River) to use the «Reinforcement: 4 points» event. Reinforcement Cost When one unit reaches 0 life point, they are dead and their model is removed from the board. When all the units from the same unit tile are dead, that unit tile is considered to be dead. The Overlord re-moves that unit tile from the River, slides the remaining tiles to the left, places the dead unit tile at the end of the River, and flips it to its bloodied side. The dead unit tile stays and continues moving normally in the River. If one or more characters from that dead unit tile return as reinforcements (see below), that unit tile is immediately flipped faceup and remains in its current position in the River. The Overlord may activate a dead unit tile. Activating a dead unit tile still counts as one of the two tiles that the Overlord can activate during their Acti-vation phase. In this case, the Overlord does not activate any models and simply moves the unit tile to the end of the River. Minions (mi-nor and unnamed characters such as Pict Hunters or Pirates) have only one life point. Lieutenants and monsters have several life points, whose number is indicated in each scenario under the River. Lieuten-ants’ and monsters’ life points are represented by a life point marker, matching the unit’s artwork and placed on the turn track. Life Points and Dead Unit Tiles Dredging the River At any time during their turn, the Overlord may «dredge the river» by removing one or more dead unit tiles from the game. To remove a dead unit tile from the game, the Overlord must permanently return 2 gems from their Fatigue zone to the game box. If there are not enough gems in their Fatigue zone, the Overlord can return gems from their Benefit zones or spell cards. If those are also empty, the Overlord can return gems from their Reserve zone. The dead unit tile is then permanently removed from the River and returned to the game box, and the remaining tiles are slid to the left. Dredging the River does not count as an activation and there is no limit to the number of tiles that can be removed from the Book of Skelos, as long as the Overlord can and wants to pay for them. Units from a removed dead unit tile can no longer return to play (including reinforcements). The event tile is moved to the end of the River, as usual, then the Overlord gains 4 reinforcement points. They choose to return the three hunters, for 1 point each (their respective reinforcement cost), returning them to play by placing them in the reinforcement areas of their choice. Having no more models to reinforce, the last reinforcement point is lost. ","8 Benefits The Overlord can use benefits to temporarily improve one of their units. Each use of a benefit applies only to a single unit, not the whole group. There are three benefits: Movement After spending the points from a unit’s base movement, the Overlord may use the Movement benefit to gain extra movement points. To use the Movement benefit, the Overlord assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to the Movement benefit zone. Each gem assigned this way grants one extra movement point to a single unit from the activated unit tile. A unit can gain at most a number of extra movement points equal to its base movement value during each activation. The Overlord can use this benefit before or after an attack. This is the only way for a unit to move after attacking. The Movement benefit can be used only during the Overlord’s turn. Guard The Overlord may use the Guard benefit to defend against an attack. To use the Guard benefit, the Overlord assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to the Guard benefit zone. The Overlord rolls for each gem assigned, then determines the defense power by adding up the number of symbols shown on the dice to the unit’s armor value. Only one Guard action can be performed per attack. The Overlord must choose the number of gems to assign before rolling the dice, after which they can no longer add dice. Reroll The Overlord may use the Reroll benefit to reroll dice after rolling dice and before the results of the roll are determined. To use the Reroll benefit, the Overlord assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to the Reroll benefit zone. For each gem assigned, the Overlord may reroll one die of their choice. This benefit can be used by the Overlord at any time, including during the heroes’ turn, when using the Guard benefit for example. Some units controlled by the Overlord can manipulate magic and use spell cards to do so. These cards are placed faceup near the Book of Skelos. To cast a spell, the Overlord must first activate the unit tile of the unit with the Spellcaster skill who has that spell. Once that unit tile has been activated, the Overlord can cast the spell in addition to moving and attack-ing with that character. Each spell has a cost 1 . This cost can be fixed or variable depending on the spell. When the spell is cast, the Overlord assigns a number of gems from their Reserve zone to the spell card equal to the spell’s cost and resolve the spell’s effects described on the card. The icon on a spell card indicates that the spell is a reaction spell that can be cast anytime. When casting a reaction spell during the heroes’ turn, it is not necessary to activate the spellcaster’s unit tile. The Overlord cannot assign gems to a spell card if doing so would raise the total number of gems on the card above its exertion limit 2 . During the End phase, the Overlord moves any gems assigned to the Spell card to their Fatigue Zone. Pestilential Swarm Attack your area, ex-cluding yourself and undead characters; roll . Char-acters cannot defend against this attack. Attacked characters suffer damage equal to the attack power. 3 3 2 1 Casting Spells ","9 T he Overlord is up against three heroes who have invaded a Pict village. They have just completed their turn, so now the Overlord gets a chance to strike back. The Overlord starts by recovering 5 gems (as indicated by the value of the recovery token in the Book of Skelos), which are moved from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone. Then the Overlord moves the turn marker one space. Conan is standing dangerously close to Zogar Sag’s hut, so the Overlord decides to halt the barbarian by sending three Pict warriors with Blocking at him. To accomplish this, the Overlord activates the Pict Warriors tile located in the River’s third position, moving 3 energy gems from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone. Then the Overlord removes the tile from the River, slides tiles to the left to close the gap left by the Pict Warriors tile, and places it at the far-right end of the River. Now the Pict Warriors are activated and ready to move and attack. The Overlord moves the three Pict Warriors that correspond to the activated tile. For the first two Pict Warriors, the movement points from their movement value are enough. The third Pict Warrior, who is in the same area as Hadrathus, needs one extra movement point to skirt away from the hindering priest and move to Conan’s area. The Overlord moves one gem from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone to use the Movement benefit, gaining the unit one extra movement point. Once each character has moved, the Pict Warriors can attack. One at a time, each of them rolls a red die to attack. The first rolls 2 symbols, which Conan decides to absorb with his leather armor by rolling a yellow die. With a result of 1, the armor partially protects him, and Conan suffers 1 damage.

This time, in addition to his armor, Conan decides to perform a Guard action for which he assigns 1 gem. He rolls 1 symbol for his armor and 1 symbol for his Guard action. He ends up taking 1 wound (3 - 2). Finally, the third warrior rolls 2 symbols, which are fully blocked by Conan’s armor and another Guard action. This completes the Pict Warriors unit tile’s activation. The Overlord can now activate a second tile (including the same tile again, for its new activation cost). Having used 4 gems already this turn, the Overlord decides to spend conservatively, activating the first tile in the river for only one gem. Once again, the Overlord removes the tile from the River, slides all the other tiles left and places the removed tile at the end of the River. This unit tile controls the three Pict Hunters with red bases, who simply emerge from their hut without costing any additional gems. The Overlord decides not to use the Movement benefit to bring them closer to an opponent and passes play back to the heroes. --2 1 1 Pict hunters 5 0 1 Hyenas 2 1 1 Pict hunters 2 2 2 Pict warriors 3 3 Zogar Sag 2 1 1 Pict hunters 2 1 1 Pict hunters 5 0 1 Hyenas 2 1 1 Pict hunters 2 2 2 Pict warriors 3 3 Zogar Sag 2 1 1 Pict hunters 2 Game Setup 1 Players choose a scenario among those available in this book (see from pages 12–41) or online at www.monolithedition. com, and then designate a player to be the Overlord. 2 Depending on the chosen scenario, players place the corresponding game board in the center of the table and place the dice nearby. 3 Each hero chooses the character they will play among the ones suggested by the scenario and takes the corresponding character sheet and model.

Constriction: A character with Evasive ignores Constriction’s Blocking effect, but not the damage from the attack. Precision Strike : When a character with this skill performs a Melee Attack, they automatically reduce the defender’s defense power by 1. Attack from Beyond: When using this skill, a character ignores penalties from unarmed attacks (see page 9) and cannot benefit from Melee Attack bonuses from weapons. Counterattack: When using this skill, a character ignores penalties from unarmed attacks (see page 9) and cannot benefit from Melee Attack bonuses from weapons. A counterattack is a Melee Attack resolved after the first attack (whether damage was dealt or not) and can be performed only if the character with this skill survives the first attack.

Bodyguard: A character with this skill can only parry (i.e. use an equipment card to defend against that attack, like a shield); they cannot dodge (see page 11) to defend a friendly character. The attacked character cannot perform a Guard action, but they can still use their Armor in addition to their bodyguard’s defense power. Any damage is dealt to the character who was initially attacked, not the character using Bodyguard. Protected: Two or more characters with this skill cannot protect each other. Movement Skills Wall Wrecker: When a character uses this skill, they spend 2 additional movement points and place the “Wall Wrecker” token on the board to indicate the opening they created.
