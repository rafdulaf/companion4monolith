["1 The Overlord’s Book V2.1 ","2 The King version of the core box is the one that was available during the Kickstarter campaign. The Book of Skelos 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Important: It is strongly advised to read the Heroes‘ Book before this one. Overview This book is intended to explain the game rules for the Overlord. In Conan, the Overlord is a full-fledged role that allows a player to strategically deploy destructive hordes, powerful necroman- cers, and monstrous beasts to achieve their own goals. Heroes seek to forge their legend; The Overlord is here to destroy it! Unlike the Heroes who each have a sheet that allows them to control a character, the Overlord has a dashboard in front of them called the Book of Skelos, which allows them to control a multitude of characters through a simple tactical game system. The Overlord’s troops are represented by tiles that group units whose attributes are identical and act simultaneously such as a band of Pictish Warriors or a crew of Pirates. Sometimes a tile represents a single central unit from the scenario, like the terri- ble sorcerer Zogar Sag or the ruthless Captain Zaporavo. This is the dashboard used by the Overlord to control their units. 1 Benefits Tokens x3: They are placed in the Book of Skelos’ top three slots and represent the Overlord’s Benefit zones. The red gems placed there allow the Overlord to temporarily increase their units’ movement, or to perform Guard or Reroll actions (see page 8). 2 Overlord‘s Reserve Zone Tile x1: It is placed in the Book of Skelos’ main left slot and represents the Overlord’s Reserve zone. The red gems placed in this zone represent the Overlord’s available energy and their ability to act. 3 Overlord‘s Fatigue Zone Tile x1: It is placed in the Book of Skelos’ main right slot and represents the Overlord’s Fatigue zone. This is where the Overlord places the red gems they already used to perform actions. 4 Recovery Tokens x2: Depending on the scenario, one of the two Recovery tokens is placed between the Reserve and Fatigue zones, and indicates the number of gems that the Overlord moves from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone during their Recovery phase (see page 4). 5 Activation Cost Tokens x8: They are placed in the designated slots on the Book of Skelos, from left to right in ascending order. They represent the activation cost of the Overlord’s tiles in the River (see page 5). 6 River: The Overlord sets up their tiles in the River in the order specified by the scenario. 7 Overlord‘s Tiles x45 (Barbarian) / x62 (King *): Each tile represents a unit or a group of units that have the same attributes, or events that the Overlord can activate. The Overlord may activate tiles from the River to take control of its units or trigger the events (see page 4). ","3 Tiles Unit Tiles All Unit tiles contain the following: Name Illustration Base color. Units from different tiles with the same name are differentiated by different colored bases. A tile with a gray outline means that no base is used for that tile’s units. Base Movement Value Armor Value Melee Attack or Ranged Attack Value Skill(s) Reinforcement Cost 1 2 3 4 5 1 7 2 3 4 6 5 8 6 7 8 The Overlord’s tiles fall into two categories: Unit tiles and Event tiles. At the start of each game, tiles are placed in the River, in the order specified by the scenario. Most scenarios use at least one Event tile: When the Event tile is activated, the Overlord must trigger one of the events described by the scenario. In some scenarios, the Event tile is used to resolve more than one event each time the Event tile is activated. The number of events, their descriptions, and the conditions for using them are specified by the scenario. Event Tiles Turn Structure In Conan, two sides cross swords: the Heroes who play together against the Overlord, sole master of their units. Both sides take turns playing, starting with the side specified by the scenario. Once the Heroes’ turn is over, the Overlord takes their turn. On their turn, the Overlord may activate 0, 1 or 2 tiles in the River to move their units and attack the Heroes. Each tile represents a unit or a group of units that the Overlord takes control of when activating this tile, or events. Once the Overlord has completed their activations, the Heroes’ takes their turn. ","4 The Overlord’s Turn The Overlord starts by moving all the gems they spent during the Heroes’ turn (on the Guard benefit, reaction spells, etc.) to their Fatigue zone. Then they move a number of energy gems from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone equal to their recovery value. The Overlord’s recovery value is indicated by the Recovery token and varies according to the setup of the scenario and the number of Heroes facing them at the start of the game. 2. Advance Turn Marker T he Overlord advances the Turn marker one space. In this example, the Overlord starts their third turn of play. T he Overlord’s recovery value is 5. During the Recovery phase, the Overlord moves 5 gems from the Fatigue Zone (red zone) to the Reserve zone (green zone). At the start of their turn, the Overlord will have 10 gems available to use. 1. Recovery Phase During the Activation phase, the Overlord can activate 0, 1 or 2 tiles in the River. To activate a tile, the Overlord moves a number of gems from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone equal to the tile’s activation cost (indicated by the token above the tile). The Overlord removes the activated tile from the River, slides the remaining tiles to the left, and then places the tile at the end of the River. The Overlord can also activate a dead tile (see page 7). 3. Activation phase The Overlord’s turn consists of four phases that take place in the following order: 1. Recovery Phase 2. Advance Turn Marker 3. Activation Phase 4. End Phase ","5 The Overlord moves 3 gems from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue Zone. Then, the Overlord removes the activated tile from the River, slides the remaining tiles to the left, and places the activated tile at the end of the River. If the activated tile is a unit tile, the Overlord activates all units of the tile, spending any number of their movement points to move them. Each unit can perform one attack during its activation. When a unit attacks, all units in that group lose their remaining movement points. The Overlord can activate the same tile twice, but they must move gems equal to the tile’s new activation cost the second time. If the activated tile is an Event tile, the Overlord resolves events as indicated by the scenario (see Event Tile, page 3). At the end of the turn, the Overlord moves all gems spent during their turn (including those placed on Spell cards) to their Fatigue zone. 4. End phase ","6 Hindering (See page 17 of the Heroes’ Book) Movement is affected by hindering. Melee attacks are not affected by hindering. Ranged attacks are affected by hindering. Tile Attributes This value indicates the amount of damage that is automatically absorbed by the unit’s armor each time a unit represented by that tile is attacked. Simply subtract the unit’s Armor value from the attack power to determine the amount of damage suffered by that unit for each Attack against that unit. Armor Value This is the number of free movement points avail- able to each unit represented by the tile. These base movement points can be spent only before any unit from the same tile attacks. When a unit attacks, all units in that group lose their remaining movement points. Extra movement points can be gained by using the Movement benefit (see Movement, page 8). Base Movement Value This indicates the number and type of dice that each unit represented by the tile rolls when performing a Melee Attack. The results of these dice may be rerolled (see Reroll, page 8), but their number and type cannot be changed. Melee Attack This indicates the number and type of dice that each unit represented by the tile rolls when performing a Ranged Attack. The results of these dice may be rerolled (see Reroll, page 8), but their number and type cannot be changed. Ranged Attack Skills are represented by icons. Their effects are detailed on the skill game aids. Skills I n the center of the village, Conan comes face to face with a Guard. The Cimmerian hits him with an Axe with an attack power of 5: Since Guards only have one life point and the Overlord does not want to spend gems to Guard (see Guard, page 8), the Guard dies and his miniature is removed from the board. The Guard has an Armor value of 2. 2 The Guard suffers 3 damage (5 - 2) which must be subtracted-from his life points. 2 - = ","This value indicates the number of reinforcement points that the Overlord must spend to return one unit represented by that Unit tile to the board. If a tile does not have a reinforcement cost, it cannot be reinforced. During the game, the Overlord gains reinforcement points by ac- tivating the Event tile. When they do, the Overlord may immedi- ately spend these points to return units to the board. Reinforced units are placed in any of the reinforcement areas, as indicated by Reinforcement tokens located on the board. If a reinforcement area is occupied (see page 22 of the Heroes’ Book), the Overlord can choose to place the reinforced units in an adjacent area. If all adjacent areas are also occupied, rein- forced units cannot be placed. Unless specified otherwise, the Overlord can spend reinforce- ment points only to return units that have been killed during the scenario to the board. If one or more units from a dead tile (see above) are returned to the board as reinforcement, the tile is flipped faceup and re- mains in its current position in the River. Important: Each Unit tile corresponds to a group of one or more units. Some tiles correspond to a single unit, such as a lieutenant or monster, while other tiles correspond to multiple units, such as a group of minions. The number of units that correspond to a tile varies from one scenario to another, but can also change during the game, depending on losses and possible reinforcements. By default, and unless specified otherwise in the scenario, the number of units corresponding to a tile cannot exceed the number indicated at the start of the scenario. A single unit may also be represented by more than one tile in the River. T hree of the green Pict Hunters were killed earlier in the game. Their miniatures are therefore available for reinforcement. The Overlord thinks that now is a good time to bring them back into play and decides to activate the event tile by moving 7 gems to their Fatigue zone (its position in the River) to use the “Reinforcement: 4 points” event. Reinforcement Cost When one unit reaches 0 life point, they are dead and their miniature is removed from the board. When all the units from the same Unit tile are dead, that tile is considered to be dead. The Overlord removes that tile from the River, slides the remaining tiles to the left, places the dead tile at the end of the River, and flips it to its bloodied side. The dead tile stays and continues moving normally in the River. If one or more units from that dead tile return as reinforcements (see below), that tile is immediately flipped faceup and remains in its current posi- tion in the River. The Overlord may activate a dead tile. Activating a dead tile still counts as one of the two tiles that the Over- lord can activate during their Activation phase. In this case, the Over- lord does not activate any units and simply moves the tile to the end of the River. Minions (minor and unnamed units such as Pict Hunters or Pirates) have only one life point. Lieutenants and monsters have several life points, whose number is indicated in each scenario under the River. Lieutenants’ and monsters’ life points are represented by a Life Point token, matching the tile’s artwork and placed on the Turn track. Life Points and Dead Tiles Dredging the River At any time during their turn, the Overlord may “dredge the river” by removing one or more dead tiles from the game. To remove a dead tile from the game, the Overlord must permanently return 2 gems from their Fatigue zone to the game box. If there are not enough gems in their Fatigue zone, the Overlord can return gems from their Benefit zones or Spell cards. If those are also empty, the Overlord can return gems from their Reserve zone. The dead tile is then permanently removed from the River and returned to the game box, and the remaining tiles are slid to the left. Dredging the River does not count as an activation and there is no limit to the number of tiles that can be removed from the Book of Skelos, as long as the Overlord can and wants to pay for them. Units from a removed dead tile can no longer return to play (including reinforcements). The event tile is moved to the end of the River, as usual, then the Overlord gains 4 reinforcement points. They choose to return the three Hunters, for 1 point each (their respective reinforcement cost), returning them to play by placing them in the reinforcement areas of their choice. Having no more miniatures to reinforce, the last reinforcement point is lost. ","8 Benefits The Overlord can use benefits to temporarily improve one of their units. Each use of a benefit applies only to a single unit, not the whole tile. There are three benefits: Movement After spending the points from a unit’s base movement value, the Overlord may use the Movement benefit to gain extra movement points. To use the Movement benefit, the Overlord assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to the Movement benefit zone. Each gem assigned this way grants one extra movement point to a single unit from the activated tile. A unit can gain at most a number of extra movement points equal to its base movement value during each activation. The Overlord can use this benefit before or after an Attack. This is the only way for a unit to move after attacking. The Movement benefit can be used only during the Overlord’s turn. Guard The Overlord may use the Guard benefit to defend against an Attack. To use the Guard benefit, the Overlord assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to the Guard benefit zone. The Overlord rolls for each gem assigned, then determines the defense power by adding up the number of successes shown on the dice to the unit’s Armor value. Only one Guard action can be performed per Attack. The Overlord must choose the number of gems to assign before rolling the dice, after which they can no longer add dice. Reroll The Overlord may use the Reroll benefit to reroll dice after rolling dice and before the results of the roll are determined. To use the Reroll benefit, the Overlord assigns one or more gems from their Reserve zone to the Reroll benefit zone. For each gem assigned, the Overlord may reroll one die of their choice. This benefit can be used by the Overlord at any time, including during the Heroes’ turn, when using the Guard benefit for example. Some units controlled by the Overlord can manipulate magic and use Spell cards to do so. These cards are placed faceup near the Book of Skelos. To Cast a spell, the Overlord must first activate the tile of the unit with the Spell Caster skill who has that spell. Once that tile has been activated, the Overlord can Cast the spell in addition to Moving and Attacking with that unit. Each spell has a cost 1 . This cost can be fixed or variable depending on the spell. When the spell is cast, the Overlord assigns a number of gems from their Reserve zone to the Spell card equal to the spell’s cost and resolves the effects described on the card. The icon on a card indicates that the spell is a reaction spell that can be cast anytime. When cast- ing a reaction spell during the Heroes’ turn, it is not necessary to activate the spellcaster’s tile. The Overlord cannot assign gems to a Spell card if doing so would raise the total number of gems on the card above its exertion limit 2 . During the End phase, the Overlord moves any gems assigned to the Spell card to their Fatigue Zone. Pestilential Swarm Attack your area, ex- cluding yourself and undead characters; roll . Char- acters cannot defend against this attack. Attacked characters suffer damage equal to the attack power. 3 3 2 1 Casting a Spell ","9 T he Overlord is up against three Heroes who have invaded a Pict village. They have just completed their turn, so now the Overlord gets a chance to strike back. The Overlord starts by recovering 5 gems (as indicated by the value of the Recovery token in the Book of Skelos), which are moved from their Fatigue zone to their Reserve zone. Then the Overlord moves the Turn marker one space. Conan is standing dangerously close to Zogar Sag’s hut, so the Overlord decides to halt the barbarian by sending three Pict warriors with the Blocking skill at him. To accomplish this, the Overlord activates the Pict Warriors tile located in the River’s third position, moving 3 energy gems from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone. Then the Overlord removes the tile from the River, slides tiles to the left to close the gap left by the Pict Warriors tile, and places it at the far-right end of the River. Now the Pict Warriors are activated and ready to move and attack. The Overlord moves the three Pict Warriors that correspond to the activated tile. For the first two Pict Warriors, the movement points from their base movement value are enough. The third Pict Warrior, who is in the same area as Hadrathus, needs one extra movement point to skirt away from the hindering priest and move to Conan’s area. The Overlord moves one gem from their Reserve zone to their Fatigue zone to use the Movement benefit, gaining the unit one extra movement point. Once each unit has moved, the Pict Warriors can attack. One at a time, each of them rolls a red die to attack. The first rolls 2 successes, which Conan decides to absorb with his Leather Armor by rolling a yellow die. With a result of 1, the armor partially protects him, and Conan suffers 1 damage.

This time, in addition to his armor, Conan decides to perform a Guard action for which he assigns 1 gem. He rolls 1 success for his armor and 1 symbol for his dodge. He ends up taking 1 damage (3 - 2). Finally, the third warrior rolls 2 successes, which are fully blocked by Conan’s armor and another Guard action. This completes the Pict Warriors tile’s activation. The Overlord can now activate a second tile (including the same tile again, for its new activation cost). Having used 4 gems already this turn, the Overlord decides to spend conservatively, activating the first tile in the River for only one gem. Once again, the Overlord removes the tile from the River, slides all the other tiles left and places the removed tile at the end of the River. This tile controls the three Pict Hunters with red bases, who simply emerge from their hut without costing any additional gems. The Overlord decides not to use the Movement benefit to bring them closer to an opponent and passes play back to the Heroes. - - 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 5 0 1 1 Hyenas Hyenas 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 2 2 2 2 Pict warriors Pict warriors 3 3 Zogar Sag Zogar Sag 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 5 0 1 1 Hyenas Hyenas 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 2 2 2 2 Pict warriors Pict warriors 3 3 Zogar Sag Zogar Sag 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 2 Game Setup 1 Players choose a scenario among those available in this book (see from pages 12-41) or online at www.the-overlord.net, and then designate a player to be the Overlord. 2 Depending on the chosen scenario, players place the corresponding game board in the center of the table and place the dice nearby. 3 Each Hero chooses the character they will play among the ones suggested by the scenario and takes the corresponding Hero sheet and miniature. They place their miniature on the game board as indicated by the scenario. 4 Each Hero also takes the Weapon, Item, and Spell cards indicated by the scenario and places them faceup near their Hero sheet. 5 Each Hero takes the number of blue gems indicated at the bottom left corner of their Hero sheet’s Reserve zone and splits them between their Reserve zone and their Fatigue zone as specified by the scenario. Finally, each Hero places a red gem on their Recovery chart on the “Aggressive” icon. 6 Meanwhile, the Overlord places the Book of Skelos in front of themselves, takes the number of red gems indicated by the scenario, and splits them between their Reserve zone and their Fatigue zone. 7 The Overlord places their tiles in the River according to the scenario and places their Weapon, Item, and Spell cards faceup in front of themselves. 8 The Overlord’s miniatures are placed on the game board, with any tokens and any colored bases if necessary, depending on the scenario’s indications. 9 The Overlord places the Turn track near the Book of Skelos and places the Turn marker on the “0” space, as well as any Life Point token as indicated by the scenario. 10 All players take note of the Special Rules, form the Asset deck if instructed to, and prepare any other game components (miniature reserves, additional tiles, etc.). Unless specified otherwise, all information contained in the scenario is known to the Heroes and to the Overlord. + ( ) + ( ) ","11 8 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 5 0 1 1 Hyenas Hyenas 2 2 2 2 Pict warriors Pict warriors 2 1 1 1 Pict hunters Pict hunters 7 6 9 3 2 Leather Armor Leather Armor 2 + buckler buckler 3 + + Battle Axe Battle Axe 4 3 0 + Throwing Knives Throwing Knives 1 + + Kris Kris 4 3 Lightning Storm Attack an area in your line of sight; roll .
